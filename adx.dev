1	Scatter and keep your mouths closed.
1	Then I got pretty tired of you and your pianos.

1	Take off that collar!
1	I must have this ring.
1	Get out! If you don't get out, I'm gonna go!

1	You wanna help me make dinner? - Uh, no!
1	Let me at him, five minutes.
1	Hey, wait a minute!
1	I wouldn't give two cents for all your fancy rules if behind them they didn't have plain, ordinary everyday kindness.
1	We haven't anything to discuss with you.
1	I just want you to leave me alone.

1	Finish her!
1	Look, I take my medications. My problem isn't compliance.

1	Did not it have to be resting? Yes.
1	And if they try to, they'll find you dead.
1	Enough!
1	Ensign Harding called and told me that you were in trouble.
1	In the old days when we nicked someone no one got hurt, and no one lost anything very much.
1	Shut up!
1	Answer my question.
1	And just what do you want me to do?
1	I demand a court-martial for murder!
1	Figure out which one you are and call back.
1	It's good you no understand my mother. It's liar.
1	No, no thanks.

1	Vinnie, we're late. We have an appointment downtown.
1	We're gonna end you..." And all this..."
1	Listen to me. Harvey is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything.
1	Not in this condition.
1	What other reason could there be?
1	Get Off!
1	I hate jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.
1	There I disagree with you.
1	The red blood lust! What else could it be?
1	Supposing I don't tell you?
1	Then give me your home number.
1	The president would like to be a friend to you, but you're making it very difficult.
1	I don't want to hear it.
1	What the fuck...!
1	Listen, I've had just about enough of your comedy, clown.
1	Calm down!
1	That's how much you bother me.
1	It is infernal!
1	What do you want, Cat?
1	You're really wasteful!
1	Well, do you plan everything?
1	Don't try to be so sarcastic.
1	Are my glasses there? Eh... no.
1	What's it to you?
1	Get out of the way!
1	You can give me two dollars extra for making me nervous.
1	Well, Mr. financial advisor. What do you think of my plan?
1	Oh, hell!
1	He thinks it's a wonderful evening and then she takes a handful of pills and overdoses.

1	Weren't you reprimanding a seaman for having his shirt-tail out. - - While the ship turned  degrees?
1	Then I'll take her when you're dead!
1	He's capable of giving this administration an enormous amount of grief.
1	Come on.
1	Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm busy.
1	Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires?
1	What are you doing? You can't come here. -Listen, Little Felix.
1	We're at an impasse.
1	Helen, we have to go downstairs quickly!
1	Fine. You win.
1	Goddamn it, Cochran, will you trust me?
1	He wants you downtown, like, yesterday.
1	I don't aim to have that threesome prowling' my property no longer.
1	It's more than my job's worth!
1	Nitrogen guns, safeties off.
1	Put it down
1	Bring him to me!
1	No, now not!
1	Your severed heads will mean nothing to the emperor
1	I'm a judge of human behaviour.
1	OK.
1	I'll fire you. I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.
1	With her, it would be marriage or nothing, and that's out of the question.
1	Turn that trash off!
1	Get out!
1	Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then...
1	It means you become their slave  hours a day seven days a week.
1	Screw the captain.
1	While you try to steal my money the union accepts an offer from Mendoza.
1	How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police?
1	I'm going to have to leave this place real soon, thanks to you.
1	I'm against whatever you're planning.
1	I don't want to hear this!
1	I didn't ride out here to pick blueberries.
1	I did not permit you to come in here.
1	Let's finish with pretending.
1	I warned you!
1	You've never shown an ounce of courage.
1	I hate this place. I hate this place.
1	Ben, move it!
1	Been trying to raise him for hours.
1	Four, this is Leader. Is he gonna be a problem?
1	You tell her.
1	You can't do this...
1	Now listen to me. This pig has cheated me out of $ million in cash.
1	Are you looking at my hands?
1	Do you want to be a truck driver again?
1	Will you shut up about the Army?
1	I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.
1	Nobody's gonna make me do that!
1	I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
1	Go on. Get the hell out of here.
1	Well, I'm not people.
1	Done." With what?"
1	We're the only ones who can afford to be honest.

1	Hastings is, in fact, mon ami!
1	Fuck off!
1	Why, what is the matter with you?
1	Keep your voice down.
1	No, no.
1	Oi!

1	What is this? My son needs his rest.
1	No, I'm not ready!
1	What is with you? What goes with you?
1	You damned near got us all killed.
1	It's just not that cute anymore.
1	What the hell are we doing out here?
1	Scram the son of a bitch.
1	What, are you guys blind or something?
1	The trouble is, a lot of highly paid favourite sons are in danger of having their rice bowls broken and going hungry, all on account of these goddamn notebooks.
1	I was just taking a rest after battling some ghosts and you say I'm blocking your way
1	You shut up!
1	Why must I always be the one who puts the cat out.
1	I got a goddamn campaign to win.
1	What the fuck is this?
1	Fuck this shit.
1	One of the theories we have is that Backpage is, in fact, in a conspiracy with the pimps, that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking, but in fact, are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement.
1	That ain't Santa.
1	Yeah, screw them.
1	Soon you'll even forget that your last name is Chow
1	And see that you get out of town.
1	Who in the hell you looking for?

1	Lubin, what the fuck took you so long?
1	The answer is no, unless you want your boy killed.
1	If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project, this bullet has your name on it, and it will find you.

1	What do you want here?
1	Want to get the fuck out of here?
1	Idle money is no good to industry.
1	He wouldn't tell us a goddamn thing.
1	We're payin' 'em back, boy.
1	You made the spell and you can undo it!
1	Where are you going?
1	When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
1	You've caused enough trouble.
1	Where do you think I've been?
1	or jeopardized our sources and methods.""
1	He forgot?
1	Warden, if you don't stop, I'll have to ask you to leave.
1	This is your one chance to get the answers.
1	Mr. Steele, this is your son's girlfriend.
1	We want you to rob drug transport.
1	You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities.
1	I'm getting darned sick of the way she's acting.
1	But you're holding something back.
1	What do you mean, you can't?
1	It was no self-defense, Brennan took him out.
1	That's kinda sick, huh?
1	I'm an American citizen, buddy!
1	Go back to the perimeter, you pinhead.
1	We should get rid of the kid and buy a new cat!
1	You think top gun up there will be able to tell if somebody's following us?
1	Would you stop harrassing her?
1	You've done damage enough.
1	There could have been better answers to some of the questions.
1	What are you looking at me like that for?
1	I didn't have time to ask.
1	Get out of the way!
1	I got enough to put you away for a long vacation. So like it or not, as of now you're working for me, understand?

1	What the fuck are you trying to do?
1	Sorry, we're not about to try this case on the courthouse steps.
1	I told you I didn't want any calls.
1	I want to see a warrant.
1	I was just trying to tidy up.
1	How come you just didn't have a baby?
1	You haven't touched a thing.

1	Son of a bitch.
1	You should've been there, Tommy.
1	Don't waste my time, comrade.
1	Well, really, you must do something about that memory of yours.
1	cause if you take two big bites and just swallow it, It could get stuck in your throat.
1	So, the ring? - No.
1	What do you care?
1	You know our man fucked up a couple feds on the out?
1	Hey, look at me!
1	Bullshit!

1	You're fucking right.
1	What do you care?
1	We don't need your sort of consolation, Father Seamus.
1	You'd better tell your friends, too.
1	Where exactly do you live? Nowhere.
1	I don't want to complain, but there's an institution called dinner.
1	I was in that room!
1	You've cost me millions and millions of francs.
1	I'm clearing out of that office everything I own.
1	Enough of your tricks!
1	Well, you're very polite.
1	What do you mean, no? You callin' me a liar?

1	I've called you dozens of times.

1	It's just beginner's luck.
1	No use leaving all those repeating rifles lying out there to rust.
1	I didn't give orders for a halt.
1	Jesus Joey, didn't you go and bat for me? It was the owner's call.
1	Drop it or the little shit's dead!
1	Happy? !
1	Mr. Starbuck, are you opposing me?
1	If you don't get married, I'll fire the both of you.
1	Shut up, you fuckhead!
1	What's got into you?
1	Do you wish me to translate Yakov's letter or not?
1	How are we supposed to raise that kind of money?
1	You're kinda that type yourself.
1	Okay, I have to study Returns and Exchanges.
1	Whatever I lost, I lost a long time ago, and I don't plan on losing more.
1	Ow! Don't run in the hallways!
1	I didn't hear no bell!
1	I know how you talk about me.
1	It's not all a lie, Paige.
1	They took her.
1	I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
1	Mr Canfil, you've fallen in with thieves.
1	What's this bullshit?
1	No! - Morning hugs?
1	Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.
1	The absence of a plan is ridiculous.
1	Come on! - Angie!
1	Hey, wait!
1	Harrigan!
1	Out of the way!
1	That's why you're getting older and she's getting younger!
1	You've been exploding frogs again.
1	I've got a piece to speak and blow hot or cold, I'm gonna speak it!
1	You're men!
1	Cain's bugging me.
1	Go with it, quick! Do not stop.
1	You may believe what you like.
1	Mommy shoulda' taught you to knock.
1	If you want Mr. Gabler to leave this house alive you must convince him you're healthy and happy.
1	He never turned up at all.
1	It's about time.
1	Hit him in the head.
1	Yeah. Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.
1	The mess boys ate the strawberries.
1	I'll do a better job. You're so out of it, you'd botch that up.
1	Nick! What the--?
1	I don't like your tone.
1	Two years an apprentice, and still the nails go in crooked.
1	It is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.
1	Stand by to torpedo!
1	Nobody's going to come looking for him?
1	You have no right.
1	Mind your own business, would you?
1	Get out!
1	Give them a taste of their own iron!
1	If he breaks the law and it crosses this desk, he pays for it.
1	Stop it!
1	I'm almost done.
1	You wanna help me? - I'm driving.
1	I told you not to count it.
1	I never signed any contract!
1	You're giving premature value judgments.
1	I demand you stop this car!
1	Look. I've been kicking ass and taking names, trying to save your fucking hide.
1	Clowns carry horns, little rubber ones.
1	Why don't you kill him.
1	Where the hell where you all night?
1	Kill him!
1	And I can't get started.
1	Get back on the job.
1	You...
1	I'll make it right with you.
1	Come on, Casey. This is no place for a clergyman's son.
1	Keep your own tips.
1	It's not negotiable, Sandy.
1	Civilians this time.
1	Well I am making breakfast here? What are you doing?
1	No, this is my daughter's night. Really. Come on.
1	It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass.
1	No, no, no, no, no, I want to know what the hell is happening to me!
1	It is time to fight.
1	There never has been a Marie Clément at your hospital.
1	Defend yourselves!
1	Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost sight of all the important issues.
1	We're gonna leave you. Do what you have to do.
1	Listen, Esther, or Rudolph, whichever one you are...
1	Not like this. I mean, fuck him.
1	I hate labels!
1	There is an American on board.
1	Sure as hell is. He called us from there five minutes ago.
1	Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he took his money with him.
1	The press briefing room, Tom, really?
1	I don't want to hear it.
1	What the hell am I living around here for?"
1	Listen, my folks is important people in California.
1	Calm down!
1	That's it, Pearlstein.
1	It is not educated. Then it repents.
1	What do you want?
1	Unsatisfactory.
1	No pension plan, no insurance.
1	I could have finally gotten my yoga certification... It wouldn't have been.
1	They gotta know Mario's gonna pull out their livers.
1	Yeah, well, we're going. -Not with you!
1	Yeah, well, she's out of town right now.
1	What the hell's going on down there?
1	Then don't say it.
1	What the fuck you doing?
1	I don't want any luck.
1	More fun and games?
1	I don't think you hear very well. I am not testifying at this trial.
1	I demand that you free the Childlike Empress!
1	He's got another woman!
1	Jessica, what's going on?
1	What?
1	No.
1	How about this. How about you call me never.
1	No!
1	Goddamn it.
1	Wait a minute!
1	Shut the fuck up.
1	What are you thinking, Lieutenant, that I'm a coward?
1	And I fear no one, Especially an unholy spirit from an unsavory world.
1	But, Edgar, whatever it is that you're going through, we can help you, but you need to... How the hell would you know what I need?
1	Then I'll take her when you're dead!
1	Get out of my way, Frank.
1	Their mandate, repeat, their mandate, is to lie, deny, and deceive.
1	I want my $200!
1	Are you confused?
1	Shut up!
1	I don't want to start rehashing everything.
1	What the hell happened in there?
1	Take him!
1	I don't like this house.
1	Look at it again, professor.
1	Down with the King.
1	What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?
1	I don't believe it!
1	Maybe you guys could like you know, get a house and buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know.
1	I don't like your faces.
1	Don't look at me like that.
1	I got troubles of my own.
1	Such spirit! Catch me if you can!
1	What are you talking about? She doesn't have a twin sister.
1	Take him away, and the others, too!
1	I believe that is unconstitutional for them to refuse to give the information to the President of the United States.
1	I don't like your tone.
1	He ain't worth the stress.
1	The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks.
1	Fuck the law.
1	I've got a piece to speak and blow hot or cold, I'm gonna speak it!
1	Buy it or wreck it!
1	It is not my Picasso, Russell.
1	In Spain ... I need a man able to impress them.
1	That's not gonna happen!
1	If you'd walked when I said, I wouldn't have been there.
1	Their style, but where the hell did they go?
1	The whole account balance bullshit, Regional knows someone's been stealing And I told them it was you.
1	He's being evasive again.
1	Calm down, fam!
1	You're kidding me.
1	The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.
1	How long has she been gone? ! How long?
1	This is war!
1	This is murder.
1	This is your problem.
1	I don't need marked cards to beat you, pal.
1	I got my eye on you.
1	This line of questioning doesn't seem particularly relevant.
1	I don't care what it costs!
1	Of course they're armed and dangerous.
1	No!
1	It is not your place to judge.
1	Before I heard about the bombing.
1	Kaili...
1	I've got my own life to worry about.
1	The fairy tale again.
1	Well, we won't stand for it.
1	Why in the hell didn't you blow those things when you had the chance?
1	I don't understand why I was transferred to you.
1	Lieutenant, do you have any idea how Broderick knows these details?
1	What the fuck you talkin' about?
1	You can't charge me for directions.
1	Lighten ship and drop all ballasts. Get below!
1	I didn't say come in.
1	All: Ohh, shit.
1	The circuit is overloaded. It's your bloody exercise machine. It's not my stair stepper.
1	He can't be there!
1	C'mon Tommy, hurry!
1	What the hell's going on here?
1	Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of an important phone call.
1	By what right do you question me?
1	Their screams... you never forget something like that.
1	I don't feel like answering any more questions.
1	I've been dancing my ass off, my feet are killing me, these shoes are too small.
1	Very nice.
1	They've been running right by me all day, Kid.
1	I don't want to.
1	It took me a week to find this crap.
1	You can beat it out of me, but it won't do you any good.
1	You break the brake.
1	What is wrong with you? Come on!
1	Watch your ass, Danny boy.
1	Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
1	You won't take my check. I'll say.
1	You're not robbing this train.
1	What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica, by powers unknown, is a direct result of the uncertainty that our presidential situation has wrought.
1	Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.
1	What kind of a deal is this?
1	No.
1	Turn off that goddamned alarm!
1	I'm the wrong guy to say that to, huh?
1	What for?
1	You better talk to her now.
1	Well, give me a coordinate!
1	Uh, not very long.
1	It's a question of principle.
1	OK, let your network know they can expect a letter from my lawyers.
1	Let's have it.
1	Fuck off.
1	It wasn't worth it.
1	It ain't worth it.
1	Either way, murder or suicide, I'd say he deserved it, wouldn't you?
1	Turn the fucking water off!
1	That's where we must attack.
1	Or what?
1	This is long, man.
1	He's lying.
1	You know he's got the missiles. I know he's got the missiles.
1	In this order we're not allowed personal possessions. Nor are we.
1	Your son is sleeping there.
1	Tough shit!
1	Sister, ten mile' refers to Ten Mile Pavilion"
1	Chill or die, asshole.
1	You don't understand.
1	It isn't, and you're gonna erase it!
1	What do you want?
1	Nobody's gonna ruin the union!
1	I know that when there's something wrong, you tell me. But there's something going on that you won't let me understand.
1	We aren't planning to build a toy, Johnson.
1	How about that whole fucking city, if you don't do what I say?
1	What good is that gonna do if the people who run this government don't have access to the programs?
1	What kind of evil spirit are you!
1	I know something about the law... and there's gonna be a law against you!
1	Look, I'm trying to find a number of Faith Thomas, in King's Cross.
1	For heaven's sake, stay there!
1	Look, I ain't got no more to say to you, OK?
1	Whatever.
1	Don't take me like I'm some corner dealer!
1	Over my dead body.
1	What is important about that action is that it was a number of Fortune  companies telling that business, that they believe there is illegal conduct happening and they weren't gonna support it.
1	I want you to get a hold of yourself.
1	No, no, no, no, no.
1	Fuck Ohio.
1	Do exactly what I tell you and there won't be any problems.
1	Some creep got into her place and strangled her.
1	It's the blood, bone and sinew of this democracy that great men handed down to the human race!
1	What makes you think we're living in this day and age?
1	Sit down!
1	Turn 'em off!
1	Let 'em have it!
1	So... what in the hell takes you to Russia every five minutes?
1	I won't let it happen.
1	So, should we still listen to what Elder says?
1	Ornery as a mule, just like Owen. -l heard that!
1	Honey, we don't like nothing soft.
1	Let's move. Come on.
1	Shut up, Flo!
1	We're fools to tolerate it.
1	You're nothing but a mad scientist!
1	Let's get him!
1	You got my respect and silence, Alberto, okay?
1	Turk, don't make fun of me.
1	What I see is what I see... We'll do what we can, Mr. Bux.
1	Mr Keith, it's contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.
1	They were a little stupid.
1	Give me my clothes, please.
1	I know everything, Marie.
1	What's the matter with you?
1	Look, I'm accused of doing something I didn't do.
1	You youngsters, be quiet.
1	Yes, but he went off without me, didn't he?
1	It don't do nothing for me.
1	You better be home tonight, you faggot.
1	Yeah, are you gonna feed her?
1	Your whole story about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit!
1	You just made it up.
1	I'm doing very well on my own.
1	False alarms were common, And they didn't help our morale.
1	In fact, we have so much evidence that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force, stated that it's an embarrassment of riches.
1	As he said, it's against the rules.
1	So, now it's time to pay the fiddler!
1	He's about to be boiled in oil.
1	That's what I pay you for.
1	It's still my hat, you know.
1	You can call it an immigration if you want to, Jim.
1	Everybody calls you plain Saunders, why can't I?
1	What in the name of god is Henry park doing in my office?
1	He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon... and then he refused to marry her!
1	Nick, look at me!
1	As you know, over here, crime is not exploited to sell newspapers.
1	Hannah turns against me, And I should lighten up?
2	Cooper, give me the nails over there!
2	How you doing?
2	What do you mean something struck her?
2	What can we eat?
2	We'll hurry.
2	What'd he say?
2	Don't worry.
2	I am ready, Mr. Dawes.
2	But do sit down and have some coffee.
2	I'll get on it first thing.
2	Well, do you plan everything?
2	And for this reason, the time has now arrived for the beginning of a very serious discussion about the philosophical and theological questions that are posed to our human family by the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
2	Bruce is coming tomorrow night.
2	Come on!
2	We gotta stick together, cos what are we?
2	Where's the lady?
2	You must go now.
2	You OK?
2	We're talking about two minutes of film. Two minutes out of .
2	You should try it.
2	You don't have any messages for me, do you?
2	You like that Beaujolais don't you?
2	You should!
2	They're waiting for enlightenment.
2	Now, how about I fix your breakfast?
2	You better have something for me.
2	This is a great exercise for the inner thigh. When I count to ,
2	And one step further from prison.
2	How ya doin'?
2	I wondered if you'd like to talk about your... desires.
2	He's gonna let one of us go.
2	collect the scratch! - What about him?
2	You think I got potential?
2	We've escaped!
2	And that's the one thing that can make Mr. Kirk Edwards fly all the way here from Rome.
2	When do we start, mate...
2	You know, we might actually have a voice that would do something.
2	Father!
2	Ready to celebrate?
2	Smash everything! Rip it, tear it, rip it...
2	What does that say?
2	You got him hooked?
2	What I want you to do is go over to your church, get crosses, and prayer books, and Bibles, and whatever the hell else you people use.
2	Personally, I think the Kid's chances are better.
2	This afternoon I want you to fly to Miami and see the distributors.
2	Who had given me knowledge, my expensive one.
2	Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance.
2	We can use Shelleen's own plan for train robbery.
2	No relatives, no friends.
2	He will help us. I'm sure that still loves you.
2	No worries.
2	Let's not waste any time.
2	Hey, warden! Catch!
2	We have to go. - Let them wait.
2	Hey, lighten up!
2	Halt!
2	Think he'll give me a raise?
2	See you Monday on the train.
2	The Montauk Club, : pm.
2	Now, they were mostly destroyed, but I was able to recover data from one of them.
2	How come you adopted me?
2	Would you like to dance?
2	You want to see a movie or something?
2	Ring it, mate.
2	Turn him off.
2	We're going home.
2	Let's shove off!
2	How's everybody doin' out there?
2	How do you like your new boss?
2	You've got a customer.
2	Hey Pops, give me one of those crazy beers.
2	I might break down and dance with you.
2	The battleships, man!
2	Jonah, bring some of that stuff.
2	It is being covered up, but, probably not for the reasons you might think.
2	If I find anything out before you get back, I'll telephone you here.
2	Everything all right, Vinnie?
2	If we take them out now, they can fight again tomorrow.
2	Carlo would love to say hello!
2	But there's no support for this appealing idea.
2	Yes, we can. - How?
2	But I think you'll enjoy his game.
2	Get out of here!
2	Earth, open up!
2	We'll be home soon.
2	If it's more important than golf, go ahead.
2	Of course, you've been here before.
2	Would you like to go out to grab a burger and then go to the movies or something?
2	I knew that there had been a trial out of Missouri, so my first thought was to contact that attorney and see how it was going over there.
2	Okay, we'll be in touch.
2	Will you see my clothes are packed and sent over to the bachelors officers' quarters?
2	Smile.
2	Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
2	It seems to me very clear.
2	I know how this city degrades the individual.
2	Green pastures await the tired sinner, and honey flows like water.
2	Give the old man a drink.
2	Why don't you sit in with us on it?
2	Why don't you kids come for a walk with us?
2	Give it a try.
2	There was a story I heard... about a wishing stone somewhere on the bank of the Mississippi.
2	I could smell it the first day you were born.
2	We've got six minutes before the brain's useless.
2	So why don't you tell me a little about yourself?
2	Go after him.
2	You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor.
2	We must get everyone in Fantasia to help us.
2	I've looked all over for shoes like that.
2	The King accepts our proposal with great enthusiasm.
2	What's the fish's name again?
2	There's something I want you to know.
2	Because we belong together.
2	This is exactly when we should strike.
2	Mrs Dickson and I are going on the honeymoon.
2	She's a very agreeable child, you'll see.
2	Okay?,
2	Well, no, but it's got potential.
2	Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love?
2	I'd like to see the rest of the guns now.
2	Well, then, bacon and eggs for me.
2	All right. I'll meet you in the lobby 'cause you're paying me to.
2	Well, Lieutenant, how are you?
2	Well, Mr. financial advisor. What do you think of my plan?
2	The desert?
2	A warship.
2	They'll love it.
2	I'm getting frightfully healthy, you know.
2	Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners.
2	Well, we should probably eat, is what we should do.
2	Before the bomb went off yesterday, do you recall seeing this man?
2	After all week it builds up... The idea is to have a ball.
2	Dinner? Well, you'll need a cocktail dress, then. Come with me.
2	Jesus. Yes, this is me.
2	What are you talking about?
2	May success follow your flag.
2	I mean, our smartphone has to be the smartest. - Yeah.
2	I'll call when I'm through with Smith.
2	Let's go downstairs and celebrate.
2	Kick 'em in the balls every time they get to their knees.
2	Where is she?
2	What do you mean?
2	We'll go together.
2	Ben, move it!
2	Fingers crossed, Jack.
2	They'll throw a parade for you.
2	Are you willing to take that chance?
2	You're just in time to help.
2	Hang on. Here we go.
2	Go on boy!
2	They'll be back in two or three days.
2	I'll call you later.
2	I just know it.
2	Well, then, come on and find out.
2	We could have one fucking good hunting trip tonight.
2	You must be confused, senor.
2	They might have a hundred guns, but it's safer down here!
2	We all wanna get out, and we're going to.
2	What exactly are we looking for, Sarge?
2	Not now, Francois, I'm busy!
2	We've cut the target adrift.
2	Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling, but help has arrived.
2	Then you'll finally be rid of me.
2	Ah, we're getting closer now to what happened...
2	Today, the captain ordered a general drill for the safety of the crew.
2	Are you a fool or a mutineer?
2	Come on, Dad.
2	I thought you didn't--
2	You and Strawn use to play when you were children?
2	We should set an example, Anne.
2	I'll have my work all finished by the time you get there.
2	Yes, can I have the Command Duty Officer, please? Thank you.
2	You Mike Kozinski?
2	You know what I'll do in the morning?
2	Bad guys! Alley!
2	Like a new song.
2	You listening?
2	We'll go on a crime spree.
2	Anyway, false hope is better than none
2	What about after you finish up?
2	You just do what I tell you from now on, Angie.
2	You know what I'll do in the morning?
2	Let's tell ghost stories.
2	If it's new committee assignments you'd like, we can certainly arrange that.
2	Come and sit down.
2	We have a pretty good idea.
2	The Navy's waiting for me to make a mistake, but I won't make it.
2	What did he tell you to tell me?
2	Well, I'd say the New York money will probably lay about... oh, 8-5,on Lancey.
2	What I want is linguini at Bruno's. A little linguini, a little scungilli.
2	Take me!
2	We've been waiting...
2	Where is Cain?
2	Tell me about you.
2	We're gonna get married.
2	We can try.
2	Frank, you're free!
2	Sign it!
2	Pleased to meet you.
2	You're not? -No, I'm not.
2	Please, I beg you.
2	Look, forget about her for a second and get in here.
2	Sure. For five bucks.
2	What kind of car?
2	Oscar, the phone!
2	I'm fine.
2	Where'd you get that?
2	Then, firm!
2	What kind of personality?
2	Just do it.
2	Hang on, hang on.
2	This is a whole new world to me.
2	If I was you, I would upload your ad onto YouTube and show them who the real genius is around here.
2	The beers are in the refrigerator. Thank you.
2	If I'm going to vote, I ought to study some of the bills.
2	Let him.
2	Yes.
2	Then I'll take her a petticoat.
2	Your services are no longer needed.
2	What you looking for?
2	I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story, but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government!
2	Would there still be a court file on this case?
2	You want me to get you a bellboy?
2	Yeah, I can just tell the way it smells that this is gonna be a great year for cotton, yeah.
2	I have to go to rehearsals.
2	How much longer is this Dickson going to hold out?
2	I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.
2	Smile.
2	Hey, put it together for Santa!
2	We'd like to welcome you to Vietnam, the country that is more stimulating than a strong cup of cappuccino or an espresso enema.
2	It will be a fine thing to do.
2	What do you say let's take a little ride?
2	Boy, that'll be something.
2	Will you go along with their agenda?
2	Anyway, these are the things that was taught to me and, if you want, I'd like to teach to you.
2	The Count says if it could be as soon as possible.
2	We'll hurry.
2	Alex, I'd like to hear it speak.
2	Uh, make sure you bring it back.
2	I'll wait for you upstairs.
2	Well, it ain't much now, Olga, but me and my partner, we got big plans.
2	They making it tough on you?
2	So, what do you want to study?

2	All I'm askin' for is a chance.
2	This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...
2	In fact, we have so much evidence that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force, stated that it's an embarrassment of riches.
2	Maybe we'll get lucky.
2	How much time did we lose, exactly?
2	Well, I do think it is difficult to let go, but believe me, the people we worked with were happy to have us let go.
2	Thirsty, Pa?
2	I mean, it's man's favorite subject.
2	That's me! Junior!
2	They'll learn quickly.
2	All right!
2	How long are you staying in Moscow, please, Mr Barley?

2	I am the one who cuts the throats of the Communists.
2	Tonight, I hand in my resignation.
2	I'm taking him out to see monuments.
2	We can't run, so we need to find a way to tell my team where we are.
2	Let's go.
2	I want some orange juice, eggs, bacon, toasted muffin and lots of coffee.
2	I thought you might be interested.
2	What's it like...?
2	I was wondering what we might expect, in terms of your testimony.
2	LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED, UNDRESS, SHOWER, BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED
2	It changes your whole perspective.
2	Unless you wanted me to stay.
2	There were no other documents? -I got everything in the room.
2	What's the matter?
2	What's this big surprise you dragged me over here for?

2	The train's slowing down. How far to the station?
2	Let's have coffee together.
2	How are we supposed to raise that kind of money?
2	I think we'd better have a drink.
2	What you gonna do about it?
2	We're really gonna have a great time.
2	Talk to you later.

2	See you later.
2	So is it true that if you commit a sin out of fear it is not necessarily a sin after all?

2	Mean gene: He's coming back, Ladies and gentlemen.
2	You wanna run get me some?
2	Congress made a clear policy choice in enacting Section  of the Communications Decency Act, and the choice was to preserve free speech on the internet,
2	One particular night we just finished our refueling mission,
2	But you're holding something back.
2	We're playing with fire.
2	Can you see anything... anything at all?
2	And I hope that someday you will join me here.
2	Why?
2	You ought to come down sometime.
2	You can show me your tan.
2	We've been waiting...
2	You like to smoke, right? You like to smoke?
2	I'll get right back to you.
2	Why me?
2	Yo, Tommy!
2	You skin will look and feel a whole lot better.
2	I'll make a special journey just to talk about myself.
2	Could turn your whole life around.
2	Let's begin with the letter.
2	You have absolutely no reason to be afraid of the King.
2	I think I love you.
3	I'm not takin' a shower with him.
3	If you ever talk to me like that again... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life.
3	Self-experimentation is against the rules of good research.
3	But, of course, she's lying.
3	An honorary stooge like me against the Taylors and Paines, the machines and the lies.
3	One should be able to take care of one's possessions.
3	Oh, I'm sorry.
3	On the other hand, they do have some rather nasty habits.
3	Now they got  of that Englishman's goons, and more are coming!
3	Nobody likes a whiner.
3	But since you insist on being treated as one, I have no choice but to oblige you.
3	He was my friend, you dumb bitch!
3	I'm really gonna enjoy this. - Give it a rest, will you?
3	We're not all masochists.
3	Ten years of tap dancing lessons and this is how you repay me?
3	Despised him.
3	Jerk. Two years away from retirement.
3	Silly old man looking after that young thing.
3	But you haven't had much respect for them.
3	What kind of a father are you, anyway?
3	Puts the bag in the basement freezer... And waits.
3	This is a mistake.
3	She won't, and you'll be unhappy.
3	He's a gutless wonder.
3	And there's the black hand that did the dirty deed.
3	But, I, after spending  years I found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our skies.
3	Still eating?
3	Apparently, Prince Philip thought that was a very important...
3	Are you a fool or a mutineer?
3	I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely.
3	Some wealthy, influential citizen merely to curry favour?
3	Like staying here all night uninvited.
3	We booked two seats, but we need three.
3	Think them folks would spend a penny to send you east?
3	You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?
3	I wanna know whose idea it was to have children.
3	If I have to compete with someone, you might let me start on even terms.
3	And I don't want someone coming here when you do tell them after you hang up.
3	You knew when I point blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.
3	He told me they're getting cold feet.
3	He that is himself a confessed traitor.
3	Trying to make me crawl and cower and cringe and admit to your monstrous lies.
3	Set us free!
3	Away from all the words, the monuments, the whole rotten show.
3	To forget one day your only obsession:
3	I don't approve of people rushing around carrying loaded revolvers.
3	Awkward ass.
3	Somebody's gonna kill you, you dumb son of a bitch, but it's not gonna be me.
3	Or it's just Bob that smells like street shit over there.
3	Now, don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
3	I know now that you're a man who employs business methods... which in Russia would be punished by death.
3	Only when the weapons were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were.
3	You took Juliette's body.
3	I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance.
3	I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society.
3	Your beloved business manager, Marty Weiner the man you stayed with, the one I begged you to leave....
3	You can't make a dead man's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse's reaction to a prefrontal lobotomy!
3	You sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you?
3	And there's a big difference between love and infatuation.
3	The press briefing room, Tom, really?
3	Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?
3	Those dopes are trying to crack open the safe.
3	You're a liar, boy.
3	I don't know what you think you're doing here, but you better get out of my office before you find yourself under arrest.
3	Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.
3	Listen to this.
3	I bet he has fleas.
3	It's ugly, old and musty.
3	How you hate the villain.
3	Now you're lying.
3	I'm really tempted to take you along with me... but I'm just afraid that I'd awaken some morning... and find you'd made a necklace with my teeth.
3	Qué pasó, shit! It's the same thing.
3	Because I did not want in your life.
3	And these people in the union are smarter than what they used to be.
3	We ain't hungry... not food hungry anyway.
3	Those dirty bastards!
3	How did you get to be a captain?
3	Put this on, and for the love of God,
3	She nearly tried to kill me!
3	That's right. The last thing we want is an international incident.
3	That's it, Pearlstein.
3	I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
3	You know, with them new suits they're makin', I bet they helping' the sun tan oil sales... all that skin to cover.
3	The dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.
3	The guy starts talking shit, so my brother picks one of them up. Shoots him right in the face.
3	How dare you, you... How long has she been in this condition?
3	I don't like to take mortgages from widows.
3	In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place.
3	Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation That has taken everything else from me...
3	Is that intelligent banking?
3	Pablo, I no longer trust.
3	You could be talking about , , kids who have been victims of human trafficking.
3	Naturally.
3	That's your funeral.
3	That's the boy's weak spot!
3	I am not the man you thought I was.
3	You did. You killed your wife. You killed benham.
3	So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable.
3	Because we need to look just like them if we want to pass unnoticed.
3	Why not throw some empathy my way?
3	It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis to get off the world.
3	Will you tell me what awful thing I did to you when you were a child?
3	Mr Keith, it's contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.
3	I'm tired of this baby crap!
3	The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men, doesn't really involve underage children,
3	I don't like your type in my streets.
3	I don't feel very good.
3	I don't know what the bastard expect of me.
3	Shayne, I know you're playing with that stupid video station, What did I say about that?
3	She got what she deserves.
3	Probably not.
3	No, no, I will not go crawling back to that woman
3	You know, there's no alcohol in water.
3	Such as I was waiting.
3	No matter how many you kill here you still won't save the kingdom The emperor is surrounded by sycophants and has no idea of the suffering of his people
3	My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
3	Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here.
3	Takes a stool to find a stool, huh, Lieutenant?
3	That's a lie!
3	Look, Doctor, this ain't Korea or China or wherever you come from.
3	See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.
3	I always said the Union National was a phoney bank.
3	Now look at all this fucking mess!
3	Nothing we didn't expect.
3	I am going to report you to the police.
3	You're both so complicated.
3	We're out of here.
3	You got something against fat people, too?
3	I'm gonna get that bastard.
3	The majority of children that we see trafficked online have been trafficked on Backpage.
3	People out there are looting the streets, robbing off hard earners, hard grafters.
3	Every day, you give this azupep a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.
3	You goin' back? Nah.
3	Have you no patriotism?
3	The president would like to be a friend to you, but you're making it very difficult.
3	There has seldom been a man so unwise, so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court.
3	You're a liar.
3	I'll fire you. I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.
3	Keith, I'm gonna be sick. I'm sorry.
3	Must be the Jamaicans.
3	You're the little guy that tried to make off with my queen.
3	It must have been that damned woman screaming.
3	Just a man with a poor taste in beers.
3	You're a liar.
3	You think I'll ever forget you running from that stupid clown?
3	I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
3	Monsters devouring human flesh.
3	You can't leave me with Ma!
3	Now that particular statement really pissed me off, because I don't think Congress did any such thing.
3	The dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.
3	No, no, no. lt's Saturday night, man.
3	No morality?
3	You found it on a bench, a dog's been at it...
3	You've never shown an ounce of courage.
3	I don't know you get to ask that.
3	I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.
3	And the smell-- it lingers, you know.
3	Such personal questions are not appropriate.
3	Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy.
3	I do not care or the wrath of God, nor of the whole earth.
3	For the love of God, Johnnie.
3	Found hair in your comb.
3	The job's too tough for you.
3	Looks like a fucking choirboy.
3	They're retarded.
3	The man is an animal.
3	Not now, Francois, I'm busy!
3	Is not it so?
3	The princess must not pick the polish from her nails.
3	I suppose like the fathead you are, you told Father all your little hopes and dreams?
3	No!
3	Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate all the work you do for him, but you and I know that my bloc is growing.
3	Why would anyone recognize me?
3	First they denied, and then they equivocated...
3	You ain't nothin' but a nigger with straight hair.
3	I don't care because he sure as hell knew after.
3	No. Edward is definitely not 'with me"'."
3	How about that mess.
3	Just this once, Kirk, why don't you empty your own ashtrays?
3	Just get going.
3	The result of this is that we're in a crisis that is unacknowledged, ironically.
3	No!
3	Lots of votes taken, but nothing has happened.
3	Just another white guy waiting for the train.
3	I certainly don't consciously realise it, and I think that's pretty rotten of you to say that.
3	The fleet didn't order us to manoeuvre at discretion.
3	You're a one-man disaster area.
3	Mr. Land...
3	How can you think that I could do a thing like that?
3	That charlatan! That hypocrite!
3	She also has a drinking problem, and I have no idea where she is.
3	You little piece of shit.
3	The old girl's finally lost her virginity.
3	The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks.
3	I don't like no one.
3	It is to you and you that my name means nothing.
3	Don't question my decisions again.
3	Paige...
3	There's no need for sarcasm.
3	How did I get such a smart-ass kid?
3	Lousy freaks!
3	But if Eben's an angel, why ain't he in Heaven?
3	I don't like it, Paul.
3	You know that the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak.
3	Is there something special about this group that interests you? No.
3	Joanna! You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
3	For the hospital, for the seriously sick.
3	I don't know what's up, what shit you've been through to put you in that state.
3	Fuck you!
3	I'm uncomfortable with whatever this is.
3	The longest game I ever played was on the maiden voyage of the Mauretania.
3	I don't want any more of it.
3	She's nothing but a common mobile vulgaris.
3	I always said the Union National was a phoney bank.
3	How did I get mixed up with a bum like him?
3	Look who's here.
3	I would like to protest the counsel's twisting of words.
3	Well, too much TV is bad for my ears.
3	I was gonna have to stab up that lanky prick for trying to take my package anyway.
3	You think you have free license to be insulting?
3	And dead fish.
3	Life, every now and then, behaves as if it had seen too many bad movies.
3	Creeps.
3	You come home, you order out food... and then you play those stupid Tito Puente albums until 2,in the morning!
3	If I didn't love these boys so much, I think I'd kill them myself.
3	That bohunk's not gonna put a circus tent on my doorstep.
3	More importantly, what the hell am I doing here?
3	Well? Where have you been? Don't tell me you tried to call me back, because I know you did not.
3	So you're figuring what? The guy she was having cocktails with did her?
3	In case it slipped your mind, it's gunnery stations at .
3	If there's any decency in you...
3	You're beautiful, Jean, but sometimes you have the bad breath of priests.
3	All she do is waggle her hips and shake her behind.
3	So we eliminate women, old men and kids.
3	They're maniacs.
3	You made a big mistake, Burkhardt.
3	He walks into the house without even knocking.
3	Dressing is common courtesy, Bastian.
3	He's of no use to no one, including himself.
3	Your husband is harboring a killer.
3	This thing goes to a man's head.
3	My God.
3	I just can't seem to throw anything out.
3	You think the clowns took him up and hung him in the yard?
3	But, Mother, he dresses like the man that cremated Uncle Leo.
3	Your Ma's in a coffin being eaten by worms.
3	I wish it were anybody's child but yours!
3	You pretend to raise money for the little league, and the whole community should lighten up?
3	Don't be so impolite in the future
3	You take pleasure in torturing people!
3	Divvy bitch!
3	You used his head for a punching' bag.
3	They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder, so you and your friends can eat off a gold plate.
3	Are you confessing to this? - Yes. I confess.
3	I don't want to hear this!
3	He says that he's looking at a giant asshole from Moscow.
3	We have lots of little problems like this.
3	You fucking little douchebag.
3	You're a disgrace to your country!
3	Women will be the death of you yet, Levasseur.
3	You've been exploding frogs again.
3	We were answering ad after ad, after ad, and we were finding that every case, every one was, in fact, someone who was prostituting themselves, someone who was being trafficked.
3	Was a nigger, was a dinge, was a coon!
3	I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta had recently been in a slaughterhouse.
3	How long do you expect the world to believe those aren't your soldiers?
3	The question is abusive.
3	Who told you to step up on my sneakers?
3	Well, I really put my foot in my mouth this time but, I don't know, I like you two.
3	Up yours!
3	Cecil, this is intolerable!
3	Who would want to live in a graveyard?
3	How can such a civilization survive... which permits their women to put things like that on their heads?
3	We are delayed. Your mother hates that we are late for the tea.
3	Oh, this place is such a mess.
3	You think I'm gonna team up with some faggot stool-pigeon.
3	You ever see a horse run himself dead just to please the man on his back?
3	I just want you to leave me alone.
3	It's cold.
3	My ex-wife is now in Long Island, in my ex-home with my ex-dog.
3	I made some dumb mistakes...
3	I wouldn't trust you with gold. That's why this is only worth a penny.
3	Sin.
3	You must come from the Stone Age.
3	It's an old saying by an old crow.
3	You'll beat me but you'll go down, Mike.
3	His skin. Like a bone or a tendon.
3	You're the very animals I was coming to see!
3	I'm gonna be sick.
3	And given your background, I'm sure you can figure it out.
3	I'll be forced to shoot you again.
3	He's wrong for us.
3	Get away from her, you bitch!
3	You know, you have a worse mouth than my kid.
3	I mean, I know writing speeches is writing... but it's not what I really wanna do.
3	She was a hooker and made it sound so great.
3	Act your age!
3	It's a dead man.
3	Lousy.
3	Your severed heads will mean nothing to the emperor
3	So, don't try to impress me with numbers.
3	You murdering fool!
3	Shot by a mad pharmacist or run over by a car while fleeing from police pursuit.
3	I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate.
3	Your skin stinks of it.
3	And w-what am I supposed to take your word for being worth?
3	You want to play games?
3	You big fool!
3	Let's talk about something else.
3	Jeanne ... Majesty.
3	Do you always lie?
3	I told you no liquor in the office.
3	And I don't need you to drop your suit because you have no case.
3	I killed her! I killed her like she was an animal.
3	You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation.
3	Standard opening. And now, you are being deliberately stupid.
3	I served next to your jellied spine for two decades.
3	You spoil me for death.
3	You killed him.
3	You're out of your minds!
3	Every sucker for himself, I guess.
3	Well, might as well make myself useful.
3	Shoddy work will not do.
3	You're drunk.
3	Shut up.
3	Well, screw the British.
3	Don't be an idiot.
3	Wait till you hear what's going down. It's strange.
3	Are you nuts?
3	I wanted to apologize for the other night And I was wondering if I can have an opportunity To see you again today and--and just talk.
3	How you helped steal an election.
3	I got a hunch Quale ain't got his mind on his business.
3	For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission.
3	If you ask me, this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen.
3	No, not tonight.
3	It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
3	I just got this crew broke in, so don't go screwing 'em up with your old-fashioned ways.
3	You're all worthless and weak!
3	Well, yesterday, he was just a guy working in the Department of City Planning.
3	I wanted to hurt a pimp. That's what I wanted to do.
3	June, your dog just upchucked.
3	You're a pussy.
3	It's too bad.
3	Summertime, all you can smell is the garbage.
3	God, it's ugly here.
3	You sleep in till noon, then you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.
3	I think I could turn and live with animals.
3	But it's The Neverending Story. I've already read it.
3	This company of adults made the decision to post these pictures without even taking the time to find out if they were children.
3	He accused me of selling out.
3	What a gruesome proof of the power of the press.
3	After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians.
3	You and Steven will be doing the dirty crockery alone this evening.
3	I just got out of a drug clinic and you manipulate me?
3	That is disgusting, mean gene!
3	Hit him with your purse, ya pussy.
3	It's all my fault.
3	These young turks, hell. Their efficiency system is just a cover.
3	I see you're as adept at breaking into houses as you are into cars, Morales.
3	Boone, listen to him.
3	Why don't you get a fucking job, man?
3	Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.
3	It's your fault.
3	Oh, your parents should be ashamed of themselves
3	Weren't nice of you fellas, trying to steal another man's horse.
3	Well, I still want him for that train robbery up at Springer.
3	I warned you!
3	You really believe that?
3	Why are you doing this to yourself?
3	Especially not to throw away your career with this team.
3	I was wondering when you'd show up.
3	That kid's a monster!
3	You want what you want when you want it.
3	Why are you dressed like that?
3	Sparks were coming out of his nose.
3	You carry the stench of death like the plague.
3	I mean % of the US population have seen these objects, but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed, that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it.
3	Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you?
3	That stupid little bastard.
3	Damn.
3	You're not? -No, I'm not.
3	Weren't you reprimanding a seaman for having his shirt-tail out. - - While the ship turned  degrees?
3	And you are the biggest liar of all!
3	What a mess.
3	That it's, uh, you know...
3	This morning they read that an incompetent clown had arrived, parading like a member of the Senate.
3	It's all for show.
3	Why did you have to sit there listening to him?
3	Don't you find that kind of disturbing?
3	There was a group that helped criminals get guns so they could shoot citizens.
3	Every time it rains, it gets all yucky.
3	From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.
3	She still eating cereal with her fingers?
3	You weren't supposed to touch Brady!
3	We were licked, weren't we?
3	That seems to me like a darn short prayer for a sinner like Dude.
3	You love your brother?
3	I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances.
3	For four years, and now it's over. For four years, I've invited the guests and bought the favors and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests.
3	And you know how vain women are.
3	We just have to find someone else with more sense.
3	Donna, you of all people should understand by now that to me, they're the same thing.
3	It wouldn't take that long if we had the right kind of government.
3	Fucking faggot.
3	There's gonna be a lot of clowns out there with firearms and itchy fingers.
3	We went back to square one.
3	Dorcas, it brings me stamps, please.
3	You have no respect for position.
3	What a creature must sit on the throne... who lets a man like you deal out his justice.
3	You feel qualified?
3	You're full of shit!
3	Bad dog!
3	That old man is a sick character.
3	We voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with.
3	Kick 'em in the balls every time they get to their knees.
3	I know you always say you're not like him. But here you are, scrubbing up for the next surgery instead of fighting for the man that you love.
3	They and the page boys are the only real class in the place.
3	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
3	Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you?
3	You run in the same circles.
3	Except when you're throwin' up in the back of Bill Fails's Chevelle.
3	They're too dumb to play with themselves.
3	You know what happens to stragglers.
3	That people would go and do that!
3	Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needle nose?
3	That guy must write real slow.
3	From here on, your education must continue in the school of war.
3	I should feed a strange mouth?
3	Don't look at me like that.
3	Escort him out of the building.
3	Don't you call my husband...
3	If ever a funeral laid an egg, that one did.
3	You talk treason and death.
3	I can't have that.
3	You make me sick when you speak, Morris.
3	And what better than to sacrifice one of the beast's own servants whom we caught masquerading as a holy sister of the Mother Church?
3	It's wasted on this bunch of Swiss bankers.
3	Well, well! If it isn't our model prisoner, looking so pretty today in his little bow tie!
3	If you lay one finger on that poor, sweet, helpless girl... you'll despise yourself forever.
3	Where's the bastard that runs this shithole?
3	She's not going to, so what difference does it make?
3	Wherever you got that specimen from, Doctor... You sent it to the chemist... While you were secretly communicating with Mr. Molto...
3	What are you shits after, apart from trouble?
3	Well, you see, over here, you know, in the United States, they have these big companies that send out these personnel directors to these colleges to sign up the bright students and their wives.
3	Oh, pardon me... Your reverend and holy slime ball.
3	But I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.
3	I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you!
3	I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him.
3	And I don't like nobody touching my stuff!
3	I know you women gotta pretend to be offended.
3	He's worse than Bobby Tex.
3	The A/V guy.
3	They're just animals, I guess.
3	You are a mutant.
3	So, you're just going to let this woman blackmail you without a fight?
3	I regret your aggressiveness, Walter.
3	It's impolite to stare.
3	On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action. - - And that we'd be charged with mutiny.
3	Cowards!
3	If a man shall be drunk on duty, he shall receive the same fate.
3	You dirty rat.
3	So, should we still listen to what Elder says?
3	All the officers were disloyal.
3	So long, suckers!
3	If I call you up in the middle of the night, tell you to come over and screw my old lady while I watch, what are you gonna do?
3	What goes through your mind comes out of your mouth.
3	I only hate you and despise you.
3	Certainly making a fool of yourself.
3	I don't want to part with it even in death
3	Yeah, that was real stupid of me.
3	Indeed throughout the entire interview... he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov which is his right name and refused to answer to the name of Strelnikov.""
3	Sicking that horrible dame on him.
3	Him!
3	Soames thinks he's a smart-ass.
3	I knew I couldn't trust you.
3	What can you do?
3	Now we have all the assholes in one room.
3	You idle apathetic!
3	I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch.
3	Lads, they're drunk.
3	It's good you no understand my mother. It's liar.
3	You're lying.
3	We don't commit murder up here.
3	I've lost another man and that bastard thinks it's funny.
3	Everything there can be interpreted as an attempt to enforce discipline.
3	What goes on?
3	It is Clang, the High Priest, who is filthy in his ways.
3	I treat her like what she is to me, nothing.
3	What good is it to cut off your heads?
3	Should I just stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek dam appropriation around my neck?
3	These are terrible.
3	Shittiest rink in the fuckin' league.
3	He's a punk, Rocky.
3	What will I tell you? That he is handsome and tall, and good and kind, and proud and so on?
3	I've had just about enough of you two.
4	It was really hard.
4	If you don't hurry...
4	This is United States Navy helo approaching your position.
4	Women and children off the street!
4	You're caught below another man's gun!
4	Before I heard about the bombing.
4	The helicopter has been hit!
4	I was plenty scared.
4	What's the matter with you two?
4	My God.
4	Don't move!
4	He's put his neck on the chopping block.
4	Don't open that door, Chick.
4	Don't ever do that to me again!
4	I don't know anything about being a commander.
4	Haven't I told you you're gonna get your melon opened?
4	What'd you do with the one you killed? I hid the body.
4	I'll listen, but I can't guarantee how long.
4	Oh, shit, he's here.
4	l had a dream that I was drowning.
4	What happened to you?
4	First I thought it was a...
4	That'd really get me in trouble.
4	Get back.
4	A lot of the gauges over the engineer's... panel are broken.
4	Back to Righteous villa? It's haunted!
4	We were robbed!
4	Do you remember when we first met?
4	Vinnie, don't do anything.
4	They would be bugging your phone, surveilling you  hours a day, and they wouldn't have tipped you by sending Agent Beeman. I-
4	Perseus is moving into danger.
4	He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens and you with it!
4	Burglars!
4	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
4	My God, stop him!
4	Brian, they're going to kill you!
4	I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.
4	The only reasonable explanation is a germ, a bacteria or a virus, that has a mind-altering effect.
4	We were wandering around, that's how we got robbed.
4	Hey, let me outta here!
4	I need to see you right away.
4	You're crazy!
4	With what money, and what about us?
4	You're afraid of me.
4	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?
4	If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify before the grand jury... It could destroy my reputation.
4	To tell the truth, Baron, tonight we're a little bit nervous.
4	But there's the challenge.
4	She... She does not speak for the rest of us, Mr. Clown.
4	I'll see if I can get through.
4	They tell me you've been on your toes since you got here.
4	What? Get off my coat!
4	Mr. Chisum, that sounds like a threat.
4	And then they'll kill us!
4	Asses burnt to a cinder.
4	Otherwise... she'll kill him.
4	Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
4	Somebody starts a rumour and they lose their heads.
4	So, are you going to tell the police?
4	Lord, camphor is the only known cure.
4	Sometimes, it makes the skin crawl.
4	and you will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space.""
4	Just please help us.
4	Well, that's a dangerous thing to do.
4	Take her, please.
4	Ring the alarm!
4	School's gonna be a problem for the kids.
4	Seemed worried about it.
4	Please. Look, this is ridiculous. You do not have to apologize.
4	Their screams... you never forget something like that.
4	I didn't know anybody was going to be killed.
4	Something's happened.
4	Something is breeding there. Underneath the cemetery.
4	Yeah. They're bleeding.
4	They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.
4	I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.
4	It's just-- it's hard sometimes.
4	There's something very wrong here.
4	What's wrong?
4	Drive!
4	Help me!
4	I don't want any trouble.
4	Don't let me go down.
4	Come on, come on, don't drop it...
4	I've got to get out before he gets back!
4	I was afraid of making a fool of myself.
4	I guess there's this part of me that hopes he doesn't even make it...
4	I do, patrón.
4	Can we talk?
4	Help!
4	How many? = All of us. - Sorry, not enough room.
4	I'm scared.
4	I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back.
4	Don't hurt him.
4	Is anybody hurt?
4	Don't go up.
4	Your face... which tells me how much you don't want to be here.
4	Come on! No, no, I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium.
4	Don't want that, now, do we?
4	There were no other documents? -I got everything in the room.
4	At the convention anything can happen.
4	Uh-ohl He's lost it nowl
4	Excuse me, sir. What about your meal?
4	I was threatened.
4	I can't take responsibility for this.
4	You're in enough trouble as it is.
4	We're not running low, are we?
4	It is the monster!
4	I didn't say I came to kill anybody, all right?
4	You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.
4	Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free, that is until... Dead Dingo Pass.
4	He ever, uh... touch you?
4	I will be punished, and I should be punished.
4	What's wrong?
4	You've had your trial.
4	Deadly and poisonous.
4	I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed.
4	There were four, uh, aliens aboard I think.
4	Don't worry about these.
4	There will be no liberty for three months.
4	You've got me worried, dear.
4	It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing.
4	I don't understand what's going on today.
4	If Nick was drugged, do you believe what he's saying?
4	It's bad there.
4	Don't.
4	Wh... what do you want me to do, pa? Git another girl?
4	Professor Henry Higgins is gonna spot us.
4	She'll be dead before the sound gets there.
4	This was not the plan.
4	And the next Backpage is gonna come along unless we fix the CDA.
4	And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
4	All those guns and violence...
4	Are you taking care of yourself?
4	Please, you have to let me go.
4	What is more sensitive than the development of the hydrogen bomb prior to its detonation?
4	Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk?
4	I do not know who plays the violin. Paganini.
4	Guns make me nervous.
4	cause snakes are scary.
4	Yeah, he's right, we got to keep moving, Nick.
4	Shh. Somebody's out there.
4	Is he dead?
4	You've got to keep him off us.
4	No, he's no Rocky Balboa.
4	If Milne's found dead, that'll make for more questions and deeper probes.
4	Are you following me?
4	Are you suggesting that I killed those women?
4	She pulls back on the trigger and at that moment I wake up screaming.
4	No! I don't know Shepherd, I swear.
4	No, no, no, no, no, I want to know what the hell is happening to me!
4	Feels like we're going down.
4	We're begging.
4	We're gonna come out dead!
4	Pray you get the chance.
4	It will be difficult for me. Suppose...
4	Help us please!
4	I can't do this.
4	No matter what's happened, this child is going to need you.
4	The trouble is, I need money for manufacturing and promotion.
4	She's going to die if you don't help me.
4	I'm through making mistakes.
4	( Knocking )
4	We ain't hungry... not food hungry anyway.
4	No, don't touch that!
4	Y-You mean we're gettin' off this submarine?
4	The others are getting suspicious.
4	And yet with all that... they still want to try it again?
4	He kept expecting a bolt of lightning to come out of of the sky and strike him dead.
4	Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel.
4	It's a damn nightmare.
4	You need money, and quickly.
4	please don't let them take me!
4	They see violence, they'll become violent.
4	Otherwise, I fear not only for the safety of our men, but frankly, for their lives as well.
4	Mr. Stern, you're playing with fire.
4	Our assessment is, Your Honor, is that they are responsible, at least in part, for both the creation of these ads and for the development of these ads. they're actually instructions to pimps on how to post an ad that works.
4	You don't bring enough men with you.
4	And I panicked, and I lied.
4	I fear really fear for the future.
4	No! No!
4	Please. Understand I was taken by surprise.
4	I just hope there's no snakes round here.
4	Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
4	I was frantic.
4	The military that uses the war machines and justifies them, and then the intelligence community that is not really an intelligence community, it's a covert operations community, armed with military weapons and nuclear weapons, and that they're trying to push the boundaries now
4	Please help us.
4	Yakov is taken.
4	As am I. The black community deserves so much better than Frank Underwood's failed policies.
4	The less the girl hears, the better.
4	Are you telling me he's carrying a. and a.?
4	No, Ned! Don't!
4	And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it.
4	No, no, no, no, no.
4	Not written on those drowned faces out there But on the faces of dead thousands!
4	Waste that fucker!
4	What's the matter?
4	Then I guess it's in God's hands now.
4	No, no!
4	What I don't understand is whether someone was trying to kill Jenny... or whether someone was trying to kill Jenny because she was with you.
4	But I gotta warn you, she can be a little vicious with the garlic!
4	Are you sitting down?
4	All I could think of was that they were going to kill me.
4	I want my money. I want to get out of here.
4	How do I plead?
4	What the fuck are you doing in my office?
4	We should both go.
4	Maybe it's best I do remember.
4	Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
4	Yes, but when the cash runs out, they'll mob us.
4	You hate guys like me, don't you?
4	Dickson will ruin this bank if we don't stop him.
4	So, now it's time to pay the fiddler!
4	The helicopter crashed.
4	All guns to fire at the turn.
4	I also know about the stakeouts, the tailings, the video cassettes.
4	I didn't know anybody was going to be killed.
4	A deal is impossible.
4	I can't think straight!
4	Ireland's been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there.
4	Shoot the fuck down!
4	Sit... down.
4	As long as they're not dead...
4	Sir, is human life at stake?
4	What do you want to do about the body?
4	Somebody help me!
4	The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.
4	Stop!
4	I believe that is unconstitutional for them to refuse to give the information to the President of the United States.
4	Somebody threw a fucking tyre chain, hit him right in the mouth.
4	I can't take any more of this.
4	Put this on, and for the love of God,
4	And time was running out fast.
4	Thank God you're all right.
4	Because you were frightened for the safety of yourselves and your unborn child?
4	Some things you just don't tell anybody.
4	Shame on the people who put us in here!
4	Well we're looking at major indictments, sir.
4	Say what?
4	Busted.
4	Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.
4	We've created a problem.
4	Well, you know, I thought we was supposed to be like...
4	A whale can jump up like an earthquake and come down on you like a mountain that somehow put to sea.
4	Something's missing.
4	Banks today have got to be careful.
4	The Navy can't do without me here, the island might sink!
4	She's wrapped all her adolescent dreams up in one dream prince, and you're it.
4	Stop!
4	So what's gonna happen to me?
4	Oh, my God, we're being kidnapped.
4	That monster is so tall, it'll see us if he stands up straight
4	I gotta get back. Move it back!
4	What's wrong?
4	All the flight crew is... either dead or... or badly injured.
4	That ain't gonna be easy.
4	Yeah, then why are you trying to hurt me?
4	But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about, either.
4	You must know how important that is to us.
4	Stay in the car, they'll tear you apart.
4	Some gang of cutthroats and murderers.
4	Oh, my God, no, I can't be bleeding again.
4	You're men!
4	Switch over!
4	You came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
4	Somebody help me.
4	That could take years... cost millions of lives.
4	Something's wrong.
4	No diaphragm in that lady. What happened to it?
4	My life is in your hands.
4	The trouble is, a lot of highly paid favourite sons are in danger of having their rice bowls broken and going hungry, all on account of these goddamn notebooks.
4	I can't fight you both.
4	Be careful.
4	It could still come back at any time
4	I changed my mind.
4	We all have ideas of right and wrong. - - But we have to pitch in for the good of the family.
4	The problem is, they already have a settlement.
4	He was killed.
4	This has been a mess since it began...""
4	All right, what's happenin' out there?
4	Roger put me onto this.
4	Father, maybe we could... Go in the other room and speak privately?
4	What's the matter?
4	She's fainted.
4	So you're going to report sister Mary to the police?
4	What's wrong?
4	Yes, son, I'm afraid.
4	Somebody's gonna get hurt.
4	And I haven't seen her since.
4	We're professionals, just like you.
4	Stay focused, keep your distance. You must not be revealed.
4	What's happening, sir?
4	That would be risking your neck.
4	He's after me.
4	I can't save Yakov.
4	All I could think of was that they were going to kill me.
4	I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate.
4	It don't hurt having' an angel on your side.
4	And the island is surrounded by warships.
4	Are you gonna shoot me?
4	Do people think I'm a carbon copy or a second-rate pretender who only got a shot because of my skin tone?""
4	He must keep you on overtime.
4	I saw those guys coming towards Nick's house just before we got out.
4	I don't want to miss this flight. I have a special rate.
4	We need a doctor, quick!
4	You murdered your own brother. -You murdered your brother.
4	Life can be infernally complex.
4	Uh-oh.
4	Darling, he'll never be able to support you.
4	Oh, no.
4	If you bleed, you'll get an infection.
4	The Feds found the lake house!
4	The court can't hear you.
4	I know that you are tough.
4	What kind? Your tools are broken.
4	He said again that the more early I was going away better.
4	You think top gun up there will be able to tell if somebody's following us?
4	And I was thinking 'Why haven't they arrested us?'"
4	No. No. I just don't want any enemies.
4	You know, they say the most vulnerable part of the human body... is the throat... and that you never really know how you feel about somebody... until they have their hands around your throat.
4	Is it bleeding?
4	Willie, you look worried.
4	It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one.
4	It put the rope to the neck!
4	Breathe normally, And ease out slowly. Ready?
4	There. You see? Someone else who knows that it's wrong.
4	Get out of there!
4	What was that shooting just now, Chip?
4	My vampire's in convulsions.
4	What happens to the gold in our safe?
4	Is he gonna be okay?
4	We don't--we don't wanna do this but...
4	I didn't see him, but he hit me.
4	I swear I didn't know.
4	I don't have any combat training, I don't think...
4	Aye, it might be the monster, all right!
4	Dangerous. Probably a serial killer.
4	All right, let's get the hell out.
4	I feel like I messed it up.
4	Those two guys and Tex, shit man, I seen them take on a gang of  guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand.
4	He's mad. It was an accident.
4	He should have been here by now.
4	Hey, no!
4	I have not!
4	And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die.
4	It was horrible there.
4	Will you be okay if I go up to bed?
4	I need some protection now from Brennan.
4	They're mixed up in all kinds of organized crime.
4	What if they catch the Captain before he gets help?
4	It's bad.
4	Am I sure?
4	They have Adalind's kid.
4	Please don't go.
4	We are so late already.
4	I want my baby back.
4	I-I took some sleeping pills.
4	I know how to use this! - Don't make me use this thing!
4	I don't think you should drive.
4	This is hard enough.
4	What do we do in case of an accident?
4	I have no defence against forgery!
4	Hurry, hurry!
4	A boy is dead and my son and husband are still out there.
4	It may bring you serious trouble.
4	Code red, code red!
4	Act natural.
4	Yes? - The keys!
4	He wanted me,
4	He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you.
4	He wants it all hush-hush.
4	Bye, Commander.
4	Request permission to leave. - Captain, sir?
4	A gunfight.
4	Help!
4	He must be in shock. This rush, this adrenaline, the fear.
4	He's ready for a fall.
4	It is infernal!
4	Help!
4	It concerns me!
4	I'm his prey.
4	Escape is impossible.
4	You're a godsend.
4	They'll disembowel us.
4	The blood's rushing to my head.
4	They'd never find me.
4	Willie, I'm worried.
4	Autumn, get out of here! Don't fight anymore!
4	It sounds frightening.
4	I'm a little tense about the exam tomorrow.
4	Cody, wait!
4	I still need it when I'm afraid, like a baby who needs a light on in the dark.
4	I am not prepared for wells to run dry!
4	You all right?
4	It may bring you serious trouble.
4	Come on! -Rexer!
4	Don't listen to her!
4	Careful, that's hot!
4	All right, I'll tell him.
4	If I give them any trouble, they cut me.
4	This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.
4	Therefore, it must be a metal.
4	It kills many brave men.
4	Don't you think he's got a point?
4	A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
4	You're on! - Let's go!
4	Everything else stops...
4	And whoever it was tried to murder me, too.
4	We're all gonna die.
4	I demand you stop this car!
4	It might get infected.
4	At night the executioner can't tell one from another
4	Any trouble, call on the phone.
4	These are death row inmates!
4	We don't know where the hell we are.
4	He knows, what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner.
4	No. - Really not?
4	That's right. It must be.
4	Run!
4	Don't go away!
4	I didn't mean to offend you. I was just being me, you know?
4	I got up and started to speak and the long powerful arm of Taylor reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the neck.
4	Oh, okay.
4	These are precarious times.
4	It's all right, don't shoot!
4	Is he dead?
4	Calder, you're asking me to make a total commitment of men and money on the basis of a hunch.
4	Then they'll say, Let's invite that Healy family over for dinner.""
4	Then what did you just stuff under your bed? Nothing.
4	For instance,  million pesos is not what it used to be.
4	Everybody is afraid here.
4	A warship.
4	They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay.
4	When a man like Senator Joseph Paine gets up and swears that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes.
4	But the crisis is now, sir.
4	When I think of it, I'm afraid.
4	Don't forget the cannibals.
4	You'll beat me but you'll go down, Mike.
4	He'd kill us if he got the chance.
4	I ought to have a doctor.
4	It... it's gonna be okay.
4	My husband will kill me when he finds out.
4	It wasn't her fault, honest it wasn't.
4	If you drop any charges against Donna, we'll drop the lawsuit against you.
4	This isn't a temple, is it?
4	Word is there may be as many as  more dead bodies up there.
4	You're contaminated.
4	Behind us! -Oh, shit!
4	The hostage negotiator's on his way, sir.
4	I was scared shitless they'd think I was still alive.
4	What's the matter, dear?
4	My grandma's really sick,
4	Don't move!
4	Don't open that.
4	Don't ever leave me.
4	I don't know anything about it.
4	Hawkins, what's your status? -Hawkins, talk to me!
4	Is he gonna be a problem?
4	I was thinking my partner had gone over the edge.
4	Don't leave me here, please!
4	Don't do it!
4	You know, Junior, I'm a little scared myself.
4	There's something terrible happening in there.
4	Don't panic.
4	More money for the Pentagon when it's own auditors admit the military cannot account for % of what it already spends.
4	Don't give up, mate!
4	Gentlemen, please don't go.
4	I'm sorry for what happened.
4	What's a girl to do when a man keeps following her around?
4	No. Not the rangers. What'll I do?
4	I never danced in public before.
4	Too much time!
4	But it's bleeding?
4	From the bowels of hell...
4	I don't know what I may tell you.
4	I see six sides to every risk and  reasons not to take it.
4	My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.
4	But in fact the level was dangerously low.
4	We'll make it to Budapest if you're not careful!
4	But there's no support for this appealing idea.
4	For God's sake, say something.
4	There's gas coming out of the wing.
4	It was an avalanche.
4	You know, this ship is going much too fast.
4	Get out! If you don't get out, I'm gonna go!
4	How much do you think he heard?
4	I have a kid. I have a kid. - Hmm?
4	He promised to pursue it vigorously.
4	How can I sleep when they stole my children?
4	You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes?
4	We have to get her to a doctor.
4	We have no choice but to use every conceivable weapon if they land.
4	You gotta get them bones growing.
4	We have to leave! Either on a plane to Brazil, or feet first!
4	Don't hit daddy.
4	I'll get in trouble!
4	He must have killed a man.
4	I didn't know what I was doing.
4	I don't want you to be angry with me for having predicted it. What?
4	Help!
4	The lady comes in sudden and she's got this gun.
4	The Kid will have to play him.
4	It tried to kill my Raymond!
4	Bring her.
4	I hope so.
4	Help me!
4	Get a doctor at once!
4	Still love me?
4	It will get me in much trouble.""
4	I think we're being set up.
4	Don't leave me!
4	You're liable to get caught.
4	Help!
4	Don't push it!
4	How do you know there was a murder?
4	I think he's been recording my telephone.
4	Just look at me. I can't get through that jungle.
5	Wonderful!
5	Actually, I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.
5	My kids can stay with me for as long as they would like.
5	I loved you for it, just as my father did.
5	They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone.
5	For the first time in my whole life, I know what I want to do.
5	Excellent!
5	I love you!
5	It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.
5	Hey, freak-face, we found your pals.
5	Then I danced in tuscaloosa and the Mayor said the nicest things about me.
5	Why, that's right!
5	Very nice.
5	Nancy, this is Al.
5	Well, maybe she could dance one more time, just for tonight, huh?
5	As always in my life, everything begins with my family.
5	Why don't you try to get some sleep now? You're gonna need it.
5	Lord Willoughby, she loves me!
5	You'll be glad to hear that the lift was working this morning.
5	The beers are in the refrigerator. Thank you.
5	Doesn't look like there's any other damage.
5	She seems to be feeling a lot better.
5	He's okay.
5	I would want no one else.
5	I like your tie, too.
5	Nice family you got here.
5	I was brilliant.
5	Good to see you're still kicking.
5	I like tacos and I like beer.
5	I think that's a splendid idea.
5	Did you know I used to be the 11th best fencer in Europe?
5	I love you.
5	Dear Bow Tie Killer, how's prison?
5	My friend, I'm a happy man.
5	Can't be worth more than  francs.
5	You'll have them for a while. Great.
5	My, we're a jolly crew, aren't we?
5	We came to love him.
5	We're rich!
5	The most beautiful TV personality, Miss Kimberly Wells!
5	Now, this is pretty great.
5	I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
5	There's some hot biscuits in the warmer.
5	Really, it is so good to see you.
5	I was brought up with beautiful words.
5	Darling, you're so good to me.
5	Not your fault, don't think that.
5	For the first time, when we looked at each other in the gypsy camp, and again at the window at the casino, and again just now, when I held out my hand to you,
5	Four degrees down!
5	Yeah, a beer, please.
5	You do, you look amazing, isabel.
5	Hi.
5	I'd give you a kiss right now, but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup.
5	We're looking good here.
5	I happen to like Melba.
5	She was so kind of offering hospitality to seven of my compatriots, refugees of our birth-place.
5	Seriously, she is a woman who loves our great state.
5	That's what I pay you for.
5	All right.
5	Oh, very good!
5	My dear, he is attractive, isn't he?
5	He's enjoying it! Can't you see he's enjoying it?
5	If it's so beautiful down there, why...
5	This is real nice.
5	In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless, graceful harmony.
5	Don't you look good.
5	He kisses my hand.
5	He's a wonderful man.
5	Yes!

6	Edith won't see her kids again.
6	I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.
6	Does this mean you don't like me anymore?
6	That was the night Michael went away.
6	Especially when there are no days and nights in it, but just days that turn black when the sun goes down.
6	Can--I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you?
6	It's too depressing to think about.
6	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
6	My grandfather gave this to me just before he died.
6	Let it go down.
6	I don't think everybody goes through life thinking about child sex trafficking in the United States.
6	I can't do this.
6	I would have sent it to you, but I didn't know your address until today.
6	Anyways, no good no more, Kid.
6	I'm not ready to retire yet.
6	You look tired, Little Big Man.
6	Enough with the water.
6	Playing with amateurs, huh?
6	You ain't got no place to go, Bonney.
6	We can't cover for him, Gibbs.
6	I'm awfully sorry.
6	Please. Understand I was taken by surprise.
6	But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying... to show me that I could never mean any more to you... than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
6	This was my bedroom.
6	I guess this is my last season.
6	It ended very badly.
6	I regret the things that I done.
6	Nothing can make up for the loss of your life savings...
6	Their screams... you never forget something like that.
6	Is this the kind of person that you are?
6	You think I killed her.
6	If Nick was drugged, do you believe what he's saying?
6	Kelly's dead?
6	It is probable that the last dose is fatal.
6	Here on holiday but seems to be having a bit of car trouble?
6	Tommy...
6	A... pointless award?
6	You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
6	You can't blame them, can you?
6	A command is a lonely job. It isn't easy to make decisions.
6	You are going to get us all killed If you keep on antagonizing him.
6	When she left me, I lost all pride.
6	Poor girl.
6	They had ten... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck.
6	I promised myself when I get out of jail, I'm gonna find a Vago.
6	Really ashamed of myself.
6	But London's a horrid place.
6	He's getting farther away every second.
6	Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
6	Where is she?
6	Why ain't my mother here?
6	You know how I loved her, really.
6	Really. - Am I no longer allowed to give gifts?
6	The moon's out, but there are clouds around.
6	Tell them it was all my fault.
6	I didn't mean to ruin your evening.
6	Things like this create a bad feeling.
6	My brother is in prison.
6	We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place.
6	It isn't like it used to be.
6	So here's the program. You're gonna tell me what is going on, and you're gonna tell me what ideas you have, if you have any.
6	I'm sorry they don't like me.
6	I can't stand to see him hurt.
6	We know you're sad, buddy, but you gotta go to school.
6	That seems a pity.
6	Grow up. Leave your mother.
6	He's after me.
6	I admit nothing.
6	How do you mean that? And now you will laugh.
6	Well, this misery in my back... ain't so good.
6	But you cannot help her.
6	I must go.
6	Help me...
6	How could he say a thing like that?
6	I have too many scars.
6	In fact, we're so bad that we're disbanding.
6	I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years.
6	Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
6	Because this could be a threat to all life on Earth if we are reckless with this issue.
6	I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good.
6	When the world is ready... for a new and better life... All this will someday come to pass...
6	Wanna apologize for the other night.
6	Well, I figure I'm screwed, right?
6	I got a wife and a family I'm not with, Dicky,
6	I get pissed off, my wife gets embarrassed, the kids are confused.
6	I know that your life is here.
6	Twelve to fifteen percent of the kids we serve were victims of human trafficking.
6	Boys forget what their country means by just reading "Land of the Free" in history books.
6	I looked everywhere for my wife but couldn't find her.
6	By the way, Phil, about your car...
6	But, you see, it's really his wife that's keeping them apart.
6	Seems like it takes a crisis to bring us together lately.
6	You made a big mistake, Burkhardt.
6	What are you talking about, dad,
6	big town? I beg your pardon?
6	Let me talk to you. - Break it up. Move along.
6	But I thought we were gonna be partners.
6	Well, I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life, that I was an outsider.
6	And then tolerance fades and faith turns to anger.
6	It's serious trouble. So many dead and wounded.
6	I'll miss that man.
6	As you can see, I'm being relieved of command.
6	I can't dance tonight.
6	Well, now there's no sunshine in my life.
6	We've lost you.
6	Love you, too.
6	Though you may think you're having fun now you only hurt the one you love.
6	Hey! So I know I haven't been the best dad in the world.
6	I didn't want to mess it up.
6	I just meant he didn't care for me.
6	Melancholy sight.
6	I get to never see my parents again or my loved ones.
6	I mean, about my having this floor to go on with my babbling.
6	No!
6	Sorry, I should have mentioned it.
6	This isn't a temple, is it?
6	I didn't want him to find me.
6	I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason.
6	I am exhausted.
6	Hank, she's dead.
6	She doesn't know.
6	I just went to the store for the cookies.
6	I am defeated.
6	Acts of homicide and cannibalism reported through the afternoon are contributable, at least in part, to these reactivated bodies.
6	My dad's gone, too.
6	They're hollow and empty.
6	Last time I saw him, he threw up scrambled eggs out of his nose on the way to the library.
6	Your mom wasn't... well, and she needed time to recover, to get better.
6	I am defeated.
6	He also does not support me.
6	Where are these kind souls that are supposed to help us?
6	Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event.
6	Vinnie, I'm not interested in this. Of course you're not.
6	But I'm missin' it, man.
6	Now, the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith.
6	Listen, I've always returned favors, haven't I, Roger?
6	Last night was not so good.
6	I didn't want you to be hungry.
6	What kind? Your tools are broken.
6	I'm so ashamed.
6	The girls have so little time.
6	I saw it coming, but what could I do?
6	This is a man's world, a brutal world.
6	You made me give up my secrets when I was feeling particularly vulnerable.
6	It's terrible that bad things happen, and all we do is stand by and watch.
6	I made some dumb mistakes...
6	I don't think I should join your campaign, you know.
6	I don't trust him.
6	You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor. That's when you hit the magic button.
6	He died a year later.
6	Well? Where have you been? Don't tell me you tried to call me back, because I know you did not.
6	Are you okay?
6	Are you confessing to this? - Yes. I confess.
6	It's not like you let me do anything anyway.
6	Look, I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.
6	Or a wolf?
6	Yeah, probably he don't gonna run, which I don't name him a top jock to ride him.
6	And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word, but, shit.
6	It was Father's Day... the last time I heard from her.
6	It's Phil. I wanted to let you know - Morse is set for tonight.
6	Bodies strung out, bodies with the skins ripped off, the hearts torn from the cadavers.
6	What a shame.
6	Is Juliette really dead?
6	I warned you!
6	I wish I had a nickel.
6	I'm sorry.
6	It's so remote I thought I would... be safe there. I figured no one could find me.
6	No, no, no.
6	When Lena got seriously ill, you sent her to a home.
6	You spent $, at The Capital Grille?
6	You should've been there, Tommy.
6	What makes you think he'll listen to me?
6	l had a dream that I was drowning.
6	It's over, Russell.
6	You see what he did to Miss Cochran's shirt?
6	But it soon became obvious that the senor was only mildly interested in the available talent.
6	I guess I don't take criticism very well. But I mean, I've had one day of work on this and two conversations about what's missing in my performance.
6	I wish I could have made her understand.
6	You said you'd never leave me.
6	I've had a very trying evening.
6	Willie, you look worried.
6	My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me about that.
6	The one that you and Tony ditched.
6	This is history.
6	Is it all gone?
6	I was very sick when I was a boy.
6	I'm sorry, Rock.
6	This is dreadful!
6	You think that by saying, "I'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
6	Yes, but that doesn't...
6	I was so alone, and suddenly you were there.
6	Why don't I do this right?
6	It was awful!
6	The moving finger had already writ and moved on, and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line, nor would my tears wash out a word of it.
6	This hurts, Charlotte.
6	I'm sick.
6	No.
6	Any more than I could on that night I saw Maria for the last time.
6	Aw. What happened?
6	Is he gonna be okay?
6	The trouble with me? I'm not very good at looking ahead.
6	You suffered severe brain trauma.
6	They hold together and bring me bad luck.
6	I've never been dumped before, that... didn't feel awesome.
6	But I paid a heavy price.
6	Boone was my prisoner.
6	I'd like your support.
6	Yes, but he went off without me, didn't he?
6	They refused to even participate.
6	Only if I deserve to be.
6	The only reasonable explanation is a germ, a bacteria or a virus, that has a mind-altering effect.
6	Underwood in office can cause damage.
6	She had long, beautiful brown hair and now she had very short, choppy red hair.
6	Let's just say I'm chickenshit.
6	This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you.
6	I really liked him. I did.
6	It was utter chaos.
6	I can't have children, Tommy!
6	See what you can do? You weren't even conscious then, for chrissake.
6	In the last century, the islanders were starving.
6	Why can't I play with you?
6	Imagine, an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
6	I wish I could believe that.
6	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
6	Because it was my misery.
6	In a shootout, five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals, the Jamaican Voodoo Posse, who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of...
6	I couldn't sleep.
6	Mike, I'm just trying to help you.
6	It's nothing. - Nothing at all.
6	Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
6	I'm not surprised. Me, too.
6	He's probably walking around here, lost.
6	As long as you're here, let me show you the books... so you can see how bad a businessman I am.
6	Fuck it, man.
6	There could have been better answers to some of the questions.
6	She just seems, I don't know, lonely.
6	Oh, no.
6	It's a liability.
6	No, it isn't. Because right now, I have to decide whether he should stay at the firm.
6	My back's aching.
6	Tusk doesn't have any friends.
6	We can go to the Fairmont...
6	We did not ditch. We were working.
6	I'm sentimental about old people.
6	Too bad the girls are in Germany.
6	Would you have preferred the Verua kill me?
6	I remember very little of my childhood.
6	I've got a scar.
6	I just keep thinking that he needed me and I wasn't there.
6	I'm telling you, I thought I was the best.
6	You've cost me millions and millions of francs.
6	Get rid of your gum.
6	I'm really sorry, Mr. Reilly.
6	It seems there's no formal contract between you and Balboa.
6	Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.
6	I'll miss that man.
6	You don't really think I don't want you to do well? No, Ma.
6	And dead ahead, is home sweet home.
6	Well, I'd like to help you out, mister. There's nothing I can do.
6	I was ambitious then.
6	Now, with such simplicity... Such clarity, everything falls into place.
6	It'll be broken by dinner.
6	I wish I were free tonight.
6	I know what you're going to say.
6	Here, at least, I'm a little star.
6	Tomorrow, Raymond... My friend and mentor, will testify he thinks I'm guilty.
6	Is that it?
6	Why don't you just go?
6	When you listen to the evidence, ask yourselves... Why Rusty Sabich... The finest prosecutor of this county...
6	It is not the one.
6	Your mom and I won't be very long.
6	I have something inevitable to tell you.
6	Well, I don't know, Captain.
6	I don't understand what's going on today.
6	Now what good is all that?
6	I am the lie.
6	They look like they've come to a funeral.
6	Just the usual complications that's all.
6	This is hard enough.
6	You don't have to say the words, Governor.
6	The deal with Tusk was a mistake.
6	No, but he's not feeling well.
6	My wife, poor girl.
6	( sighs ) I thought I got some good news.
6	I'm sorry.
6	Poor girl.
6	There's nothing you can do.
6	You hate me.
6	A Parisian only goes to the Tower in moments of despair to jump off.
6	Five Wounds, for short.
6	We want to die!
6	You're blacking out, waking up in places you don't remember, bleeding from where you were shot.
6	Why do you stand or sit as far away from me as possible?
6	Please, stop doing things.
6	Not a happy one.
6	They took the one with the collar?
6	I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.
6	It was my fault.
6	She said that I put on airs. That I use big words like gesture" and "devastate.""
6	They hold together and bring me bad luck.
6	There is nothing I can do.
6	I'd rather die.
6	That means he's flying it.
6	And denied.
6	Forget it, that's enough.
6	Oh, come on. It just would have been some cushy white-collar resort.
6	So you don't know what happened.
6	Florence and Junior have been kidnapped.
6	I can't sleep.
6	There's not much we can do.
6	We are finished.
6	He's capable of giving this administration an enormous amount of grief.
6	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
6	Nobody remembers number two.
6	I asked you to dance three times and you didn't wanna.
6	Yes, it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off, too.
6	I was window-shopping in Oxford Street, daydreaming about what I'd buy for her, if I had any money.
6	And I haven't seen her since.
6	What's the use of getting excited, Cluett?
6	And now they've lost it.
6	I'm just as old as I look.
6	You've promised to think about it.
6	I shall not translate.
6	This is just horrible.
6	You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here.
6	Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too, or maybe he doesn't want to know.
6	It's just not okay to be alone anymore.
6	I just don't want to see anybody hurt.
6	I got it, but I don't know.
6	I can't do that, Vinnie.
6	A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder.
6	That's a shame, isn't it?
6	You knew when I point blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.
6	I'm sorry.
6	I went crazy.
6	Times have changed, haven't they?
6	He told me they're getting cold feet.
6	I am sorry.
6	The same all grind week after week. And so much stress.
6	When I got back to the hotel, I couldn't sleep.
6	It's a bit humiliating, always borrowing Anatoly's place.
6	Never I will understand the women.
6	Spare some change? No.
6	There's nothing else I can do.
6	May he rest in peace.
6	You go ahead and let the grieving process happen.
6	When I'm wearing a new bonnet... all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head.
6	There's nothing I can do about it.
6	I want to go.
6	The rolling balls, the second-hand phrases, the migraine headaches... Shirt-tails, and tonight's speech: I turned yellow but my dog likes me.
6	I'm sorry, I didn't think.
6	Florence is not gonna have a baby.
6	She told about the squalor and filth into which she and her brother were born, and how they grew up like animals.
6	I'm sorry to hear about your little loss.
6	It must be a mistake, he was clever...
6	Feel better?
6	Many of you aren't wearing battle gear.
6	That high is not the one you're looking for. Believe me.
6	The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle.
6	He's the town joke, and I'm stuck with him.
6	Get her back for me, please.
6	The queue was endless.
6	My grandparents were killed in the war.
6	You're not the man your father was, Reilly.
6	I bet you're starving to death.
6	You don't understand.
6	If we had known, we would have greeted you with flowers.
6	Oh, he didn't do it for you, Nick.
6	The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him.
6	There will be no further mistakes from the officers and crew.
6	Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost sight of all the important issues.
6	We can't have that.
6	I'm too old to be traded in.
6	I'm leaving you, my dear.
6	There's no way you could make them talk. You're dealing with extremists.
6	Now, then I find myself in Albuquerque with no money.
6	No, not, Hastings.
6	Nobody knows how to talk, just grunt at each other.
6	We were all praying for a miracle.
6	Sorry about that.
6	They're blaming me for it.
6	I spent most of my life in institutions.
6	I knew there'd be a catch to this.
6	There. There.
6	When Michael died, Erica was only five.
6	Hans waved me off.
6	That last part, there's something off about it.
6	Then there's the third murder, and we can't find any connection between this one and the first two.
6	I don't get your generation's humour.
6	She told me that you've been going through some things... in your personal life.
6	There were some problems with...
6	For you to become a murderer?
6	He's in trouble. Boy?
6	Nick, that was your new partner.
6	Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances.
6	Or merely a lack of imagination?
6	Please stop!
6	Some people don't like my metaphors.
6	Otherwise, what good am I to them?
6	It's not your fault the plane landed in Boston.
6	It's not right to leave it in there.
6	or jeopardized our sources and methods.""
6	Tommy, will you ever get out from under Rocky's shadow?
6	I wanted to blame myself for my dad's drinking, for my mom's crying all the time and her emotional breakdown.
6	Jerry, it's just a disease.
6	I don't know how to do anything else.
6	All I wanna do is clean it up, get it right.
6	I don't feel like sitting down.
6	I don't want to harm you.
6	He's a little bit grumpy right now.
6	I have worked and struggled to make myself an American.
6	How did you find me?
6	I know it's a terrible time.
6	There's no escape.
6	I thought I was the best stud-poker player in the world.
6	I'm sorry if I spoiled a print.
6	He'd undergone a lot of strain.
6	Ah, yes! 'I had a migraine, your Majesty.
6	Why would anyone recognize me?
6	He was my brother.
6	And just what exactly are your intentions, young man?
6	They're all dead.
6	What am I gonna do?
6	But really, was there any choice?
6	O dear me.
6	I know how this city degrades the individual.
6	I won't live long.
6	I'm not investigating her for working for you, I'm investigating her for felony fraud.
6	You know I talk to it sometimes, and I beg it to wake me up.
6	I'll never get this. We're doomed!
6	Stripped of all that it's no wonder they become suicidal.
6	He can't be your friend.
6	Pa's no killer!
6	No!
6	You did or did not get those records? - I did not.
6	I know you think I'm crazy.
6	I know you are, but this just got  times harder for me to get out of.
6	I really belong in jail.
6	But you can't.
6	I don't know. I don't know.
6	I can't.
6	I feel so bad for Nick.
6	We haven't eaten yet.
6	There's nothing we can do.
6	How can I make you believe me?
6	I don't want to argue.
6	How sad.
6	I was hoping you'd be spared all this.
6	If we could be like this forever it would be great
6	How do you know what I want?
6	I don't want to die!
6	Your old man's a punk.
6	Say bye-bye, now. Bye to daddy.
6	My dear lost love!
6	I can't dance tonight.
6	Sorry, Bill, I didn't mean to scare you.
6	I'm not usually this fragile.
6	I loved our life together, the school, subway walking you home, the two weeks we took in St. Thomas.
6	The fish that got away is always the biggest one.
6	I want to leave Mr Case's employment.
6	But I told you never to fight a street fighter fight.
6	I suppose that she forgot or he did not think that it might die.
6	I guess I'm afraid you'll find me out.
6	Well, it can't be helped now.
6	Well, if there's been a mistake, it's yours.
6	He's all tired out, though, the poor little guy.
6	Ouch! That was the antigravity backdrop.
6	And I've loved something that doesn't really exist.
6	I failed you.
6	I saw her just once more after that wedding night.
6	I feel sorry.
6	Ah, you should have stuffed her in the car with the friend.
6	Well, this may not be the best time to bring it up, but a  call just came in.
6	We're looking at economic instability, we're looking at housing instability.
6	We are delayed. Your mother hates that we are late for the tea.
6	What's killing the children?
6	What's more to the point, that money was next year's budget for the Drug Rehabilitation Clinic.
6	I don't like my boys getting hurt permanently.
6	I'm really sorry.
6	A desecration of what used to be the finest.
6	He's a real choirboy.
6	I guess she's gone for good.
6	Not fully.
6	I feel As a tear.
6	We can't live with lies.
6	That money was going to change my life.
6	They've been kind enough.
6	In your world if The Neverending Story is fading no child will ever know about Junior.
6	No!
6	Now I just drink like an Irish person.
6	He's wrong for us.
6	He shouldn't have to decide here.
6	I know bad that this mission cause you grief, lady. Is of great importance for our country.
6	I broke my heel on my shoe.
6	Now I know how a poor little guinea pig must feel.
7	What the hell for?
7	What the fuck are they doing in there?
7	Where are you taking it? - To the hospital.
7	He's an asshole, but you'll get used to him after a while.
7	He's taking the day off?
7	Five years ago. Bingo.
7	Fifteen hundred?
7	Don't we need supplies?
7	And what do you think those old geezers really miss in Florida?
7	What that!
7	Oh, hell!
7	Don't I remember you from somewhere?
7	Not the way it is.
7	Look. Look! Look!
7	Everyone wanted to do the oral argument, that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there.
7	Of course, a box!
7	Doesn't a doctor have to do that?
7	Who took her body?
7	I get twice the work done around here. - You know why?
7	I guess that's why the old man gave it to you!
7	How many years to come?
7	Is it true the ballet's moving out?
7	Two men believed responsible for the attack were captured.
7	I thought they said they was from Rome.
7	I also know about the stakeouts, the tailings, the video cassettes.
7	I felt all warmed and funny inside. I can't describe it.
7	I haven't seen you for days.
7	Why didn't you tell me?
7	It's as if ordinary human beings, living ordinary lives, had suddenly vanished from the Earth, and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people.
7	I don't want to raise him by myself.
7	I have defeated you?
7	Why didn't you ask me?
7	I thought your little cousin was going to sell the stock.
7	Duck!
7	I can't.
7	You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
7	What's all the celebrating?
7	Is he really our cousin?
7	Okay, I'm sorry, all right?
7	Why did you ever go there at all?
7	Help me!
7	Don't you live at home?
7	Yeah, that's right, Lancey.
7	On an island famous for its fruit and vegetables?
7	The land down under? That's a fabulous idea!
7	He is the owner of Texas.
7	I can't believe that.
7	Right now. - Right now? - ( chuckles )
7	None of this was Juliette's fault.
7	When did you discover that?
7	No.
7	When I got back, we were short two blokes' rations.
7	Why are you dressed like that?
7	Ah. You believed in it and you fought for it.
7	Oh!
7	What's the big deal about Him suffering on earth if He knew He was going to rejoin His Father in Heaven?
7	Is this some sort of a gag?
7	What's he doing there?
7	What's got into you?
7	The ring!
7	What happened?
7	What, are you smuggling furs or something?
7	He cooks better than his ma!
7	What am I doing here, Clark?
7	Think I'm an idiot?
7	But and the Duchess?
7	Who was that girl?
7	Where'd you get this, exactly?
7	Is this the kind of person that you are?
7	You know Mr. Franconi and Mr. Valli from before?
7	No, I don't like it.
7	No. Not the rangers. What'll I do?
7	Lord Chiang! Lord Yang! Lord Lee!
7	Let me have secrets.
7	Lucito, huh?
7	Everything all right, Vinnie?
7	Oh, my goodness.
7	Who?
7	More than two?
7	He said no pilots.
7	How did the trust fund end up in Jane's name in the first place?
7	Mr. Caulfield? You all right?
7	Isn't this a school day?
7	Isn't that the truth?
7	Hey, girls! Hey, baby.
7	Not exactly funny, it's just that you're so different from your son.
7	Did you not once direct Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard?
7	Right, Lieutenant?
7	What's the matter with my policy?
7	Look, it's Bernard!
7	Hurry!
7	Okay, that didn't help at all.
7	Why aren't they over Diamond Head?
7	Now, this man is good.
7	Um... I'm always getting myself into these kinds of things.
7	Don't we like Leon?
7	Hi! - Woman: How are you?
7	Well... I guess that means that you and I have gone From being friends to being enemies.
7	That'd be great. Thank you.
7	The old man can still catch, huh?
7	The Martians had calculated their descent with amazing perfection.
7	You don't know how to train?
7	What?
7	What? !
7	You clean up real nice.
7	Ms. Wirth, this is an outrageous situation.
7	One of the waiters tells me she's got quite a reputation for not mingling.
7	The old man was right after all!
7	What on earth have they been doing to you?
7	That's a stolen car.
7	Two whole days!
7	You, the most innocent of them all?
7	You're not married?
7	What is this? My son needs his rest.
7	Um, should I wait for you? No, no.
7	The heavyweight champion is down!
7	You're going to the police?
7	Wherever did you find her?
7	You know something? Off the screen, I don't think I've ever seen you laugh before.
7	What then?
7	Adrian, what's happenin' here?
7	Steve, I thought you'd be amused.
7	The horse? - The horse.
7	You mean somebody she let in opened the windows so it looked like a break-in?
7	You're full of surprises.
7	You're a month early for the book fair.
7	OK, fine. Then--
7	You were winning?
7	When we invade France, What will the help of Spain?
7	Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry, but I...
7	Look, I won!
7	Looks like we got a slumber party on the third floor.
7	I though you didn't like blood sports.
7	I do not even know who you are.
7	How can you think that I could do a thing like that?
7	It was, uh, bound in human flesh, inked in blood.
7	The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her she was with the National Transportation Safety Board.
7	Everybody else laughs at it, but not you.
7	That's a big surprise.
7	We gotta do something!
7	Rocky Balboa has done the impossible.
7	You mean, you could sell us but you won't?
7	What's this about a film?
7	A desecration of what used to be the finest.
7	Was it a cop?
7	Vinnie!
7	What's going on between you two?
7	Was it so difficult?
7	Jesus fucking christ. - $? - Yes, sir.
7	The clerk said she left with one of those two Cuban Hebes.
7	O dear me.
7	Do you like it? - I do.
7	But I will not attempt one here and now.
7	God, she must really love you.
7	What?
7	Where did he go?
7	You never know what is looking ... or what you think.
7	You know what we ought to do? Steal the money for ourselves.
7	You're probably wondering what I'm doing here in this box.,
7	Okay? You're gonna check in with me on a nightly basis.
7	You sure you ain't got me mixed up with somebody else?
7	Sounds great, but what is it?
7	Chu Kot? ! Are you Elder Chu Kot traveling incognito?
7	They took Juliette's body? He can't even bury her?
7	Who were you expecting?
7	It provides us that delicious house over there.
7	This horse is a running motherfucker. - No, shit. - Yeah.
7	Charles, my dear!
7	The one that you and Tony ditched.
7	Oh, Evie!
7	Is it supposed to work right away?
7	Can't you see I'm playing pool, bruv?
7	Great view. I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.
7	Are you kidding?
7	But I didn't sleep yet.
7	Do you believe that?
7	Women just love single male parents.
7	Ostentatious, that is!
7	No.
7	Hey, come on.
7	Why are you laughing?
7	Why do you writers take such chances?
7	Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
7	Oh, my god! For $,, anyone who put-- puts this here - And pulls the trigger.
7	Someone's shown up to bail the city out.
7	Why on earth did she come here?
7	And if I kissed it... and made a wish... it'd come true.
7	You were right.
7	You wouldn't close him down if you were Sov, would you?
7	Oh my God.
7	How do you know?
7	In the last two years of his life, he gave away most of his fortune... in large, anonymous donations, to your charity.
7	How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
7	Impossible!
7	Madame is canceling the engagement?
7	I thought I liked to party, but these guys...
7	The archery machine!
7	Oh my God!
7	What the hell is going on here?
7	Won't those two years in court be expensive for you?
7	Tonya!
7	Get them!
7	Her medicine!
7	I decline to answer your question. I decline to answer your question.
7	What's going on?
7	You never used to drink it straight like that.
7	They were never there, this never happened.
7	A beautiful woman like you?
7	If you don't, somebody else will.
7	What the hell happened in there?
7	What the fuck are you doing in my office?
7	Where did Charles Martin get his share of money?
7	Didn't he tell you that the mess boys ate the strawberries?
7	He's wrong for us.
7	For an hour. An hour?
7	Finish her!
7	Don't you believe it.
7	You know, you're gonna get yourself killed.
7	I'm fucking great.
7	Did you want to see me?
7	bat-blind ships.
7	I never scouted this neighborhood.
7	So here's the program. You're gonna tell me what is going on, and you're gonna tell me what ideas you have, if you have any.
7	No, those were rumours.
7	Why did you do it?
7	Nick killed Juliette?
7	You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
7	I guess Rocky's got more sense than both of us.
7	This is your idea?
7	She died trying to save my daughter.
7	Jesus Christ! Murderer!
7	Jesus, this is a fairly young guy.
7	Nick, that was your new partner.
7	That's the boy wonder?
7	They took his coat.
7	You know, come to think of it, It is a rather interesting conception.
7	Shit!
7	Funny you should say that.
7	What is it?
7	She did what?
7	And what happens Tuesday?
7	Oh, is that Maxim's idea?
7	So you don't think that's funny?
7	You know, because you think of generals, and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business.
7	He shouldn't be a cop.
7	You know, I never saw this episode.
7	Tell me what?
7	Just when I think you're dead, you always come back.
7	Ah, Dante, old chum.
7	Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
7	Trubel?
7	Father Pearson told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself.
7	What happened?
7	It's impossible. Chappie...
7	No.
7	I never imagined what was a work for woman.
7	It's impossible. Now time is up, New York's doing it's audit.
7	That just can't be.
7	Oh, how can you tell that from here?
7	Where's all the money today?
7	I don't believe it.
7	I don't mind it if you call me Claire, you know.
7	What on earth have they been doing to you?
7	No diapers?
7	%? !
7	Was that the phone?
7	I don't know what I'd...
7	You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?
7	Suck on that. Hey, who's there?
7	I don't know what it is
7	Well, I never thought I'd see the day.
7	You let me down, Mike.
7	Yes, but that doesn't...
7	If Nick was drugged, do you believe what he's saying?
7	Birth of some issues right there.
7	I can't believe it.
7	Well, that's very poetic.
7	We have to look beyond normal.
7	We got a real mess here, man.
7	Were you a guest?
7	Judge, it's our theory that Mr. Sabich is being framed in this case.
7	Wait!
7	I wonder what he's doing with Mr Cluett.
7	For God's sake, June!
7	Complete reversal of usual behaviour pattern.
7	Haven't seen you for a while.
7	That's absurdly hypothetical.
7	What's all this for?
7	A bus?
7	Of course, it's absurd that a priest would be involved.
7	Who was so interested?
7	I got a gift for you.
7	I had no idea!
7	How many? = All of us. - Sorry, not enough room.
7	Is it... and look who's there!
7	Two rings... purse.
7	I thought they were with Mackenzie.
7	I always seem to come up smalltime. Except all of a sudden now, this guy Strom falls right in my lap out of sheer luck.
7	I find this hard to say without sounding condescending, but I'm proud of you.
7	I headed into the English old country Looking for help.
7	Why didn't you tell me?
7	I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that.
7	I have to go now.
7	Why didn't you take her home?
7	I took a valium. Feel like I'm drunk.
7	Easy, brother.
7	I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.
7	Yeah, well, we're going. -Not with you!
7	You hate him....
7	Hey, they're... they're shutting the door.
7	Who would do something like this?
7	I thought you'd question him.
7	Hey! What's up?
7	I don't know what caused this great interest in us?
7	I don't know. I must think about it.
7	My God, he's done a wonderful job.
7	Lancey?
7	In charge of piers and warehouses?
7	But I can't volunteer anything.
7	I don't mean to be handing you no line, but that's pretty hard to believe.
7	I thought you were supposed to eat fish on a Friday.
7	Whoa! - A goldfish.
7	But I'm her spiritual adviser.
7	Darling, it just doesn't make sense.
7	What? !
7	If he is to be sacrificed before Kaili, why is he not painted red?
7	I don't know what to say.
7	I thought he didn't have any trusted friends except you.
7	Phyllis, they just caught this guy.
7	Oh, here we are. - Oh.
7	Tommy, the baby?
7	And people do the strangest things, too.
7	If that's all what we all thinking, why isn't someone just come right out and say it?
7	I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.
7	Mac...
7	Were you together? Yeah.
7	I've never done anything like that before in my life.
7	I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
7	I don't believe what we have done.
7	I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.
7	Maybe you sleep together once in a while.
7	You never wore that before.
7	Why have you no hangover?
7	You can't leave me here alone.
7	Admiral know what that is?
7	Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again.
7	I get this he runs a good operation" shit."
7	Good heavens, isn't there any revolt in you?
7	I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect.
7	Environmentalists call it a disaster.
7	I thought it was the old man's
7	You sound further away than that.
7	I thought you said that they transferred him.
7	Who do you think it is?
7	What a wuss!
7	Why don't you just go?
7	Why is he letting him go?
7	That's darn cordial of you.
7	I don't believe it.
7	Why look at me that so strangely?
7	Look how I've changed!
7	ESP exists, Grimm. They proved it.
7	I never wrote it.
7	That's terrible!
7	I can see that!
7	Probably turned into some potluck, poster-making, sing-along.
7	Oh, come on, it's just a joke.
7	But these are criminals.
7	Oh, is that what you told the general?
7	I didn't know you were a music aficionado.
7	Jeff, aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry?
7	I didn't know anything about this.
7	Griffin, ain't you gonna do nothing?
7	I didn't know you were married.
7	Looks a lot like your house, doesn't it?
7	Didn't the formula cure his rheumatism?
7	How did this happen?
7	I never thought I'd make it.
7	No, no, no, I don't mean that.
7	Mr. Levine knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question.
7	I've saved you guys from big junk collars, traced lost stuff, fingered stools.
7	Okay, look, the last thing we knew, she was getting on that helicopter.
7	Why did you get married?
7	On your head? She hurt my head.
7	You know, all fairness to alcohol, I've done stupid things when I was sober, too.
7	You're not beginning that again, are you?
7	What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
7	You think top gun up there will be able to tell if somebody's following us?
7	No, it's just... I read in this thing that's what I'm supposed to do.
7	That's right, $,.
7	No, Bastian!
7	To cover it up.
7	What's this with the orange bow on here?
7	Oh, I think not.
7	She's wrapped all her adolescent dreams up in one dream prince, and you're it.
7	What's the matter with you? What happened?
7	You got our package back, man.
7	This isn't a temple, is it?
7	The suspect's body, who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat, was discovered late last night.
7	Charlie! Sorry.
7	He's so cute.
7	You're on! - Let's go!
7	His words are too profound
7	Who let you in?
7	You'll sell the furniture?
7	Oh, my god.
7	It sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers never lifted a hand to stop us.
7	But they'll accuse you of helping me escape
7	She really do all that dancing?
7	Listen, today is my birthday and the girls give me a party.
7	You have changed.
7	Fantasia!
7	God, you're probably right.
7	But I couldn't help noticing, despite the habit, that you're quite young.
7	I can't believe this is you, Ben.
7	Um, uh, push three?
7	I was just calling because I'm having a game night.
7	The first person who's nice to us is another out-of-towner.
7	Shit, you scared me!
7	And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment, which we do not and which we will prove.
7	Uh, something like that, yes.
7	It's working.
7	You didn't get legal advice?
7	There's somebody out there.
7	There I was, face to face with Ben Wade.
7	Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?
7	Oh, you almost got me.
7	Mother of God. Hawkins' dog? - You said pig.
7	Aren't you gonna do something?
7	With the transit trouble, I didn't expect to see you on time.
7	Certain camps where the men aren't paid enough or fed enough or protected against disease enough.
7	Or merely a lack of imagination?
7	You think I thought this was gonna happen?
7	He did?
7	Who wears a thing like that?
7	Hey. I can't believe you got here.
7	There's a airplane on you. - You drew an airplane on me?
7	I would like to proudly present the newest member of the Healy family, Junior!
7	The princess has been acting very strangely.
7	What a man!
7	Hold on, there.
7	You get around on those wheels pretty good.
7	She's turnin' around!
7	Why is he naked, Sergeant?
7	There's somebody at the door.
7	These darn things are heavy!
7	Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
7	How do you know what I want?
7	He was gonna die?
7	I hadn't heard you'd sold the place.
7	When we say not bad, we don't mean not bad." - We mean it's bloody marvelous. - Yeah?"
7	Is that so far from your desire?
7	I've never seen anything like it before.
7	How do you mean that? And now you will laugh.
7	Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.
7	Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time?
7	Why aren't you chasing ambulances?
7	Did I hear something about jewels?
7	I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing.
7	Uh, I'm not remembering anything.
7	You think I got potential?
7	If I hadn't seen you on the news, I wouldn't have known who his partner was.
7	I think my cook has managed guess what I like.
7	Isn't there a guard?
7	It must be a mistake, he was clever...
7	Hello?
7	I can't believe it myself.
7	Is this Roger, who we went to Seaworld with?
7	But who would buy the boat?
7	Why did you run away?
7	What have you got in there, Marlowe?
7	These are the wrong keys.
7	You get lost?
7	Why are you here?
7	It's incredible stupidity...
7	Grab the hand rail!
7	He remembers everything.
7	I'm getting numb all over.
7	Excuse me, sir. Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about?
7	Thought I saw some resemblance.
7	Why me?
7	Then why are you hanging around here?
7	Wasn't he that shop's bill collector?
7	Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
7	That's a hell of a story, Bell.
7	What's happened now?
7	Gold!
7	I thought your favourite was chicken.
7	Really.
7	Carolyn never seemed worried about anything like that.
7	Hey, warden! Catch!
7	I just had the weirdest dream.
7	I sit here and I can't believe that it happened.
7	Seems he has a taste for beef.
7	How'd you find us?
7	He suffered me to buy him a new suit... and to get him a job at his old hospital.
7	Ensign Harding called and told me that you were in trouble.
7	I'll be surprised. What about  years?
7	Can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
7	That guy must write real slow.
7	It looks better on you.
7	I thought you were fast asleep.
7	If not Kirk, who is it?
7	Hey, we got a survivor!
7	What the hell are you doing? -Ackerman!
7	Isabelle. Isabelle! It's finished.
7	Why did you choose Chipping Sodbury? There is a convent there!
7	The psycho-vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder.
7	More! - More?
7	He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices.
7	Mr. Chisum's changed with the times.
7	Isn't this about professionalism?
7	Isn't that what this is all about?
7	Not exactly.
7	Did you really think he would come with you?
7	He struck you?
7	Do you really want to know?
7	I wouldn't have believed it.
7	No.
7	Mark Usher's no one's friend.
7	It's an incredibly profitable, as horrifying as it is to say, business.
7	Oh, my!
7	But I don't know anything about Martinique.
7	I thought I was someone who I wasn't.
7	Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids.
7	Now what's all this?
7	Noel equals Leon." This is Carolyn's handwriting."
8	Jack to the king.
8	In the past we've had our differences but I'm sure they can be worked out.
8	The choice is yours.
8	You need a hand with those?
8	Barney! Barney, what a day.
8	Oh my, where are my manners?
8	Come on now, let's go home.
8	You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J. Doyle too much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said that was pretty private stuff going on out there.
8	But there is nothing to be alarmed about.
8	Oh, yes.
8	But if you care about us, you do not do this.
8	I need you.
8	I've always had faith in him.
8	I'll fly tomorrow to Sardinia and tell you all I know.
8	Not me.
8	But you have me.
8	I would like a water turtle, and this gentleman is interested in a dog.
8	I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.
8	Aw, I'll do what I damn well please.
8	We've got the best soldiers in the German army here.
8	Yes, I was responsible.
8	But the existence of the National Reconnaissance Office remained secret for over  years.
8	Styles Court, totally supported by her. You. Inglethorp had been his generous benefactress.
8	I'll take care of Miss Swanson.
8	She's lovely.
8	and very loyal to Francis.
8	It's been an honor to serve with you.
8	I find your presence comforting somehow.
8	All you have to do is be our pal.
8	After all, it has already improved.
8	Promise?
8	And do remember me kindly to your charming wife.
8	Nobody could ever say different.
8	Maybe I can help you.
8	That's true.
8	May I use your phone?
8	That's right, sister.
8	I'm gonna take you to a nice, quiet place.
8	All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation.
8	A vocation to love God, help the poor, solace the sick and dying.
8	I will get off there and my chauffeur will take you to your destination.
8	Thanks for telling me.
8	My wife does not exaggerate.
8	That'll do it.
8	You're a godsend.
8	Ah. He tucked my parents into bed every night.
8	If you see her, hang on to her.
8	Well, I cannot accuse you Of not making us comfortable, Captain.
8	I was worried about you.
8	Alfred Inglethorp must not be a prisoner, Chief executive.
8	You're the only one with the experience. No, Luke, I do not have the strength.
8	Can you help me out with this crazy wiring on the socket?
8	With us, the police force, detectives, inspectors.
8	I'll respect you even more.
8	Our friend would never leave prints.
8	The present danger is ended.
8	I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way, but we must preserve a respectable front.
8	Everybody's a screwball in some way.
8	I know you have.
8	Will you see my clothes are packed and sent over to the bachelors officers' quarters?
8	Like a million Fourth of Julys all rolled into one.
8	Very well, I won't pry into trade secrets.
8	Go on.
8	You do not let me down.
8	Just do it.
8	You've done the right thing.
8	You have to have faith.
8	Everything that could go wrong was considered.
8	You don't have to call me Father.
8	Take care of my son here.
8	You are strong.
8	Nevertheless, I still believe that you love.
8	You're more resilient than I gave you credit for.
8	I know he was your friend.
8	Thanks, man.
8	Even collects stray boys and cats.
8	Why don't I save you the trouble?
8	Some fight.
8	What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight.
8	I'd like you to stay at my house. 
8	Any friends of mine are friends of his.
8	Miss Bianca, I would be most honoured if...
8	That's right, boy.
8	Bobby Tex is okay, he's done all right for us.
8	I was fixed up on a blind date by a well-meaning friend.
8	Take it easy, I'll get you loose.
8	And that's exactly what I'm going to do.
8	You make things possible, Mr. Bernstein, and I've been afraid for things to be possible. Miss Lechea, your check.
8	If they does, I'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again!
8	Why do you hate everybody?
8	Don't worry about a thing.
8	You look like a man of property.
8	He's home free.
8	I won't. I promise. Goodbye, sweetheart.
8	What'd he die of?
8	I don't mind saying that I was scared because Tony is known as a shooter.
8	I'm supposed to be taking care of you.
8	She says it's a sin to kill things.
8	From now on I want you to report directly to me and only to me.
8	Oh, Jimmy, yeah. No problem.
8	I know I can win the captain's confidence, But I need time and I need your help.
8	I think the answers make you wise, but the questions make you human.
8	There's my favourite little boy.
8	It's not too late.
8	And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
8	Because if you love somebody, you live with them, you live for them.
8	I hear the gossip at work about your marriage...
8	Well, as long as you feel that way about it, the gun is yours!
8	You were so good.
8	Now look, Captain, you're an educated man.
8	This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you.
8	I love you.
8	We believe what the gods did when they made a man crazy was... make him fall in love.
8	You might hold this for me.
8	I am varsity captain as a freshman.
8	Well, I'll tell you one thing.
8	We assume that no commander of a US naval ship can possibly be a coward.
8	Naturally, Mr. Edwards will pay all your expenses while you're being tested.
8	One can learn a great deal from him.
8	I never said monster.""
8	I love you.
8	If I had to do it again, I'd do it.
8	But I gotta warn you, she can be a little vicious with the garlic!
8	I mean, he makes a very fine officer.
8	I want to tell you, Reilly, you've done a marvelous job.
8	That, my boy, is much more to the point.
8	I love it.
8	You ought to know your way around here pretty well.
8	Of course. You're a big supporter of my opponent.
8	Rusty steers good.
8	I just kind of like it, that's all.
8	Nick, this is David Ackerman.
8	All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em with heart, not muscle.
8	I need you.
8	It will be, will be.
8	No more tears.
8	Sleep well.
8	I might be able to accommodate you.
8	Aye, aye, sir.
8	You even die for them.
8	Well, I'll tell you one thing.
8	The hospital in Switzerland confirmed Edith's story.
8	We all have our own ways of running a ship.
8	Thank you.
8	Thanks.
8	Welcome.
8	If you come back, I promise I'll never do anything naughty again.
8	I'm glad you're here to see nothing goes wrong.
8	Yes, I come back, baby.
8	I might do that.
8	You will help our medical research and thereby saving thousands of lives.
8	Think I should go out with Paulie?
8	In front of millions. That didn't stop Mike Tyson. Luke, remember...

8	It was good therapy after my divorce and my miscarriages.
8	I know what these jerks are like.
8	I agree with you.
8	Of course.
8	What? Thought I was gonna leave it to you?
8	Such as I was waiting.
8	I am an expert on this.
8	Charming, all of you.
8	We'll reinforce them later.
8	Praise our Lord Jesus Christ.
8	I got a ship to run.

8	This is United States Navy helo approaching your position.
8	You tried to recruit her once before.
8	Ninotchka, let me confess something.
8	Therefore, we do here and now band ourselves... into a brotherhood of buccaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas.
8	Nobody.
8	You should just get over what happened to you in your adolescence. It is time to move on.
8	Thanks for looking after me, Mac.
8	I've thought this out very carefully and I know what I'm gonna do.
8	I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
8	That's excellent.
8	Our best hope lies in what you people can develop to help us.

8	You know how much I enjoy your high style of playing.
8	I believe in your sweat.
8	I love my country.
8	All you gotta do is run into him.
8	I'll tell your dad I did, okay.

8	If you need me, just pull this.
8	All right. I'll meet you in the lobby 'cause you're paying me to.
8	We'll start with an easy program.
8	You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition.

8	Will you promise?
8	Manchester has a good drummer.
8	I hope so, for your sake.

8	You just be quiet. Be a nice girl.
8	You'll find I'm pretty well-connected here.
8	Now you're talking sense.
8	We will follow the trail of Christine's boyfriend.
8	And if there's anything else you want, just holler.
8	I got something here that belongs to you.
8	Including this latest brainstorm. I think you will do an amazing job.
8	You'll do it from the deck of a ship in command of a task force.

8	We was safe there.
8	Preparing to move. Three passengers. On schedule.
8	Me, too.
8	And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.
8	A pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler... money is never an end in itself but simply a tool, as language is to thought.
8	So it is!

8	Sam was good to me.
8	But he's not alone anymore.
8	I am so proud of you.
8	Stay here?
8	Something I can do to help you?
8	It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you, Robocop .
8	You know I've been in situations, where, like, I've been shot at. You realize that, right?
8	It's because you're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily.

8	Mom's right, Shayne,
8	How you doing?
8	I got a friend bringing some dough.
8	He's really nice.
8	You know, I'm really worried about the kid.
8	I'm pretty sure I didn't kill anyone for it.
8	You know we'll do whatever we can.
8	Mr. Steele, this is your son's girlfriend.
8	Your sins are forgiven, my child.
8	I'll give you the money.
8	I think I love you.
8	Ladies, I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros.
8	Couldn't agree with you more, Mr. Johnson.
8	You want to come inside?
8	I really appreciate that.
8	Because he's the future.
8	You're doing good.
8	I felt obliged to come and pay my respects before moving on.
8	Thanks again for the job for Melanie. She'll make a great receptionist. She's got an outgoing personality.
8	Could I get a level from you, please?
8	We must protect these investments so the area can continue to prosper and grow.
8	I'll... bet the size of the pot.
8	I know this sounds weird... There's no place I'd rather be.
8	One of the waiters tells me she's got quite a reputation for not mingling.
8	He was very clever, so it was very hard to find out about.
8	I've kept it in my pocket for  years.
8	Can't you humor him? I need a favor.
8	Of course she know them perfectly.
8	If there's anything you want to say, I'll be glad to listen.
8	Of course you can.
8	If you, Miss Maclaine, know of any proof about aliens, you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out, but I am skeptical.
8	She is right.
8	I'd want to pay you both.
8	Will you leave me a few for a room and something to eat?
8	Say the word.
8	Darling, you'll be just fine!
8	Because I want to talk to you, face to face.
8	How 'bout a drink?
8	Hello, darling! Hello, dear.
8	Well, I want to thank you and your wife for all your help.
8	Thank you.
8	Shalakazam.
8	She saved my life, actually.
8	You got my respect and silence, Alberto, okay?
8	Will you look after Melanie for me?
8	We're together on that, aren't we?
8	I'll call your  and raise you... .
8	You're right.
8	Mr. Tunstall's been teaching me.
8	Helen and I really did care about you.
8	I can find the best lawyer.
8	Mr. Tunstall loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading.
8	Welcome back, Rocky.
8	We've solved problems before.
8	Nemo has won him over completely.
8	He's really been like a father to me.
