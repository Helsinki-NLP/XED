1	Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired.
1	There are a hundred other places that really need the water!
1	Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies.
1	You ain't gonna get nobody to come out here.
1	It's all your fault.
1	Rocky, you're losing your family!
1	Fucking gas company.
1	Kuka päätti ottaa teidät Harold Greerin tilalle?,Why didn't you tell me?
1	Fool.
1	Anyone who would deface a work of art with a color like that ought to have his ass removed.
1	Forget it.
1	Even if I told you what was the matter with you, you wouldn't admit it.
1	You're not just a crook, but a murderer.
1	Shut that door!
1	I'm not asking permission!
1	All right. I've heard enough. I've heard enough.
1	Fuck 'em.
1	That's ridiculous.
1	So do you want eggs or not?
1	Congressman Lewis is  minutes late as usual.
1	Running away? - Don't look for trouble, Tom.
1	Let go! Hey, get off of me.
1	See? See? See?
1	See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.
1	Outrageous!
1	A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.
1	Steve, make them pipe down.
1	Everybody thinks they're humorous, but they're not.
1	Break every mirror in the palace.
1	All I want to do is make things as difficult as possible.
1	Don't try to tell me my business.
1	You mind your own business.
1	Some of you think you can outsmart me.
1	How can he see pink? It's a black and white picture.
1	The Beauty queen Howard?
1	So, fuck it. I figure I've got to straighten him out a little bit.
1	Shoot it!
1	Hey! You're nothing but a little girly devil.
1	Where were you?
1	Can't I do what I think is right?
1	Get off my roof!
1	Who took the Scotch from my closet?
1	Do not worry, he does not know anything.
1	I'm busy as the devil!
1	I'll get a lock on my door and keep your ass out of here, Mookie.
1	Now get out of here.
1	Come on, then!
1	Come on, damn it!
1	Hey, you cannot reject me.
1	I saw those guys coming towards Nick's house just before we got out.
1	Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
1	Might hit him on the head with one.
1	Because I do not like you, Mom.
1	Understand? What?
1	I told you to keep away from that radio.
1	You will order your officers to work.
1	So what do you want from me? Huh?
1	Fuck! Fuck!
1	Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.
1	You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman.
1	No, jocelin, listen to me, I-- - no, it's just--
1	You can tell him that for the both of us!
1	Sweetheart, what are you doing home?
1	What is it you want?
1	And then he says, l sure hope he was guilty." Then he laughs."
1	You have one minute.
1	The girl escaped... the other one and my son are looking for her.
1	No!
1	You took her from my house last night!
1	And that they wouldn't hold Backpage responsible was very disturbing to me.
1	Damn you!
1	Christ! We've got no alternative.
1	Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command.
1	See. after our parents died. we were left to fend for ourselves.
1	Please sit down, sober up.
1	He forgets easy what that money cost me.
1	But what I tell Maria to do, she will do.
1	Go get them! No!
1	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?
1	I'd rather die.
1	Put my fucking car back on the track, will ya?
1	That's the trouble with you.
1	Yes, you may think that we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.
1	What's he got to do with this thing?
1	I tell you somethin'.
1	Didn't you tell me to call you in five minutes?
1	You can put that away.
1	Shut your mouth!
1	Please, Dani, ple... - You have to love me,
1	Thirty years a Sheriff and all I've had to contend with are vicious animals.
1	A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends, our loved ones, our children.
1	I'll fucking kill it!
1	Excuse me.
1	She nearly tried to kill me!
1	Don't you see what's happening? If you don't find me a killer, there is no fucking office!
1	Fine, till you come along.
1	Put your swords down!
1	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
1	Could have used this a week ago.
1	Lighten up, Chief.
1	Everything there can be interpreted as an attempt to enforce discipline.
1	No, thank you. No, thanks.
1	Then why don't you obey?
1	Get out of here!
1	Not another word from anyone.
1	Be quiet.
1	Cut out all that talking, Leo.
1	He was completely misquoted.
1	Get out of here!
1	I order all ghosts to be expelled!
1	You can't even call? We'll be stashed away.
1	Can't make out her name tag.
1	By next Friday, you'll have your money.
1	My God.
1	I can't tell you that!
1	I don't like the way you are looking at me.
1	I do just tell in my mind.
1	Meaning what?
1	Who the hell asked you anyways, huh? -Shut up!
1	Could you guys shut up in there?
1	They've been running right by me all day, Kid.
1	Hey, fuck off!
1	Get in the car!
1	Sir, I don't care about the blame. I care about the safety of my team and I care about getting those Stingers back.
1	I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
1	How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
1	For if I'm not physician, how is it I know that you're a dying man?
1	All hands to rescue stations!
1	I can't believe anything you tell me now.
1	There'll be no more talk of the captain being crazy.
1	You're outnumbered and outdone, Bastian. And you have only one wish left. So use what's left of your brain and wish to go home.
1	Seek out and engage the enemy."
1	Take it off!
1	Stand here and argue.
1	We don't want speeches.
1	Till I had to put a stop to that myself!
1	You listen to me.
1	Hey!
1	Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable.
1	I think you're stupid.
1	As am I. The black community deserves so much better than Frank Underwood's failed policies.
1	It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on.
1	Now, the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith.
1	I was wondering when you'd show up.
1	We thought anybody can understand this.
1	Goddamn law is ruining the country.
1	You stay out of my way.
1	So you and me are gonna make a little arrangement.
1	Are you confessing to this?
1	People always do what you tell them to do?
1	They're retarded.
1	You got a badge and a gun but you're still a punk so shut up- - Bobby, please!
1	Press down on her!
1	Will you let me sleep?
1	You hit me again and I'm gonna rip your face off.
1	You know, you could pay me. That's one way to break the ice. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
1	He should, he's got a lot to be thankful for!
1	My officers will not do manual labour.
1	No, we're not done but you are.
1	One more word and I'll cut you down!
1	I refuse to sign it.
1	I know what these jerks are like.
1	That's done it, he's gone.
1	Get lost!
1	Hurry!
1	Nick is not gonna let you go unless you tell him where she is.
1	I can smoke you out of there easy.
1	Don't tell me to take it easy!
1	Don't push it!
1	I can't get this blasted thing started.
1	She doesn't care.
1	Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities.
1	If we let those bastards get dug in now, we'll have to level the building!
1	So that you could tell me this?
1	Stay away from...
1	Out of the way!
1	Sit down!
1	You know, you remind me more and more of my first husband.
1	I'll put you back on the team, but you must promise not to drown out the other children.
1	Autumn, get out of here! Don't fight anymore!
1	Find the most tender and vulnerable, to destroy his heart.
1	Seize fire to the Castle!
1	With your popularity, you'd be out in no time.
1	I'll take you back and dump you.
1	I demand you stop this charade! You... Demand?
1	There will be no more movies for  days.
1	You don't have to believe it, honey, just act it.
1	Get out!
1	Come on!
1	If you want to catch that boat you better stop talking.
1	I want those two guys banished from her life.
1	Oh, fuck him.
1	You are just one too many!
1	Shit!
1	Are you guys nuts?
1	Keep the line straight!
1	Bring her back, girls, alive!
1	As I said, sir it all depends how far we're willing to go.
1	It's just the beginning.
1	Fuck you!
1	Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon?
1	How dare you, sir!
1	So, if we destroy the camera, they'll have no choice but to come in and film you themselves.
1	Now, that doesn't go in there.
1	Your blood will thicken.
1	We'll catch 'em sooner or later.
1	If you were a man, I'd break your neck for that.
1	Tell them to get the hell out of there.
1	You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again.
1	This is between... me and him, and no one else.
1	Where's the money?
1	Damn it, get in here!
1	Mark, I was the one who had the worm. Thank you.
1	Shut up, Sheryl Ann.
1	Shouldn't we be going?
1	Hey, wait your turn.
1	One matters of saying to us, Mr. Inglethorp, where it was in the Monday afternoon, day  of June?
1	Tell me the truth, son!
1	Damn!
1	No, no! - Let's go. - It's supposed to be here!
1	Shoot him!
1	That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life.
1	No man is gonna make a liar out of me, sir.
1	Get out of here, before I make you beg for your life.
1	Drained their life savings, ruined hundreds of lives, and made off with over $ million.
1	Who cares, we're getting outta here.
1	How much further into the rectory are you going to push it?
1	Turn around!
1	Particularly child trafficking.
1	At 10:00,tomorrow morning, I want you to bring into my office either a letter denying emphatically that your remarks had any mystic implications or a letter of resignation.
1	You hurt me. Yes.
1	Get out of town!
1	Otherwise I'm gonna fuck you up good!
1	I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately.
1	I'm gonna kill it.
1	But if the last powder was taken there is two days it cannot be very important.
1	So, you're just going to let this woman blackmail you without a fight?
1	No more questions.
1	Does that make you more comfortable? - Man:
1	For the tenth time then, will you stay out of this Attinger thing?
1	This prick's been cheating the whole game.
1	More!
1	Get out!
1	Don't you get it?
1	Unless you're afraid of getting burnt.
1	Quiet!
1	Get off! - Outside, please.
1	Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
1	Under the circumstances, I have to advise Rusty not to respond. Clearly, he would like to.
1	This is no time for jokes.
1	Think I'm an idiot?
1	Put up your hands!
1	This is my life we're dealing with.
1	Open the windows!
1	I don't want to talk to him. I'll call him Monday.
1	Even so, quite wrong to threaten. Not the way to treat an enlisted man.
1	Told you not to call me that.
1	You got something to say about our plan?
1	Think God punishes the King to have a French whore.
1	Yeah, mind your own business.
1	Come on! -Rexer!
1	I'll be out in a minute. - There's no hurry.
1	They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here.
1	I won't tell it anymore.
1	Pull those drapes!
1	Get on!
1	I know exactly the situation I'm in.
1	But you do remember this, don't you?
1	Leave me alone.
1	l want to see her.
1	Weren't you, in fact, intimate with the lady?
1	Don't even breathe!
1	Get your hands off him or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
1	Do you have to make such a racket?
1	I don't like reporters.
1	Do you see how this affects Larissa? You don't?
1	Let's put him on the payroll.
1	What money, asshole?
1	Then we can't let him get away again.
1	I can tell when someone lies to me.
1	Why don't you back the hell off of her?
1	I'm a nice guy up to a certain point, but don't get me sore.
1	You will pay me back.
1	You've caused me enough trouble already.
1	Until it took a hit in the head.
1	Turn back the clock?
1	I said hold your goddamn fire!
1	Bullshit.
1	Open the door!
1	What's the matter with you?
1	Come on, this is me you're talking to, Mike Brennan! Come on, Chappie.
1	You've got ten minutes to clear out.
1	A dead man has one half-hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
1	RJ and Feather could move there, and he could be the mayor of Stupidville. Stop.
1	Come on, Jessie, move over.
1	But you still haven't answered me.
1	Come back, here!
1	Please stop it.
1	Knock it off. Will you knock it off? !
1	I gave you , so you owe me  bucks. Okay?
1	I'm not afraid of your threats.
1	What do you think I am, stupid?
1	Come on, get up.
1	Do not trifle with your luck.
1	NOW!
1	Just hear me out on this, OK? I've known you a long time.
1	I am through being a go-between for you and your dream girl.
1	Come on!
1	About time!
1	Don't you dare turn that off!
1	Showtime.
1	We'll show them you're not afraid.
1	He brought in his own detective to replace Harold Greer.
1	Could've told the truth, fucked them all, had the cigarette with me. That is such bullshit!
1	Reluctantly, I may add.
1	No, no, they don't.
1	I do not know!
1	You stool for him, fuck.
1	The idiot had his TV turned up, and I didn't--
1	You go when I tell you to go.
1	Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.
1	Come on, I'm old enough to be your father.
1	Open the door!
1	I'm not that high.
1	As you can see, I'm being relieved of command.
1	Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
1	So you'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge.
1	Who you looking at?
1	Nick. - It's Chavez.
1	Cut it out.
1	This is America. Speak English.
1	This is rusted tight.
1	Thirty years in this fucking office.
1	All those guns and violence...
1	You're making no sense here.
1	I cast thee back to hell. To hell!
1	Be quiet.
1	But I just escaped from here! Don't you understand?
1	The cops found Glockisi Greg's trust.
1	That's not gonna happen.
1	The monster is here! Abracadabra!
1	On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action. - - And that we'd be charged with mutiny.
1	I'll listen, but I can't guarantee how long.
1	No you can bring that back.
1	Things like that are none of our business.
1	We have a shop rule here, no liquor on the premises.
1	Not for a little while, no, ma'am.
1	I'm gonna fuck you up.
1	I don't owe you jack shit.
1	Amateur.
1	Now, you stay put and listen to me.
1	For your information, I was at Woodstock.
1	Come here!
1	He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon... and then he refused to marry her!
1	This is a fucking nightmare.
1	Look... I don't know who you people are, but I saved the child's life, didn't I?
1	Go back to your work.
1	Don't you understand?
1	You can't see him because you're not dead yet.
1	Don't talk like that.
1	Forget it.
1	Shut up and put your hat on!
1	I'm gonna do it alone!
1	How many times do I have to tell you? You don't know what you're dealing with.
1	I don't want any lesson, Shooter.
1	Hastings, it did not seem to him strange which Lawrence Cavendish was suggesting what had the mother been poisoned by accident?
1	I'm gonna see it if I have to go blind trying.
1	He asked you not to get those records?
1	Oh, he didn't do it for you, Nick.
1	Hell!
1	Don't be tricked by his devilish voice!
1	This is no time for foolish tricks!
1	Get away from her, you bitch!
1	I won't let Jessica live like this.
1	Fucking come on, then!
1	Kill that cat, Kid.
1	This blood is mine! Do you understand? The blood is mine!
1	No one picked on you, Stephen.
1	You're out!
1	Satan, stop!
1	I can raise my voice in my own home.
1	That'll teach you to go around saying things about people.
1	I'm not interested in what you think.
1	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers, so it's hurting.
1	How come they're happier than us?
1	Blast off.
1	You were supposed to come Tuesday.
1	Come on. Cut it out.
1	I'm supposed to be taking care of you.
1	Bad news. Your father cleaned out your bank account to pay for the damage to his store.
1	They can't keep the department out of it.
1	No, no, no. Shit.
1	If you don't mind, you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle.
1	Perhaps I have become, as you put it, obsessed by our name and our past, and the absence of our future, and by our paintings.
1	Come on, Paulie.
1	Don't a man have a right to know what he's signing on for?
1	Do what he says:
1	I might have expected your thanks for what I've done this day... but very well, let it be so.
1	The girl is my concern, not yours.
1	You rat!
1	No, she's calling your home.
1	You son of a bitch.
1	No more out of Mr. fucking Calabrese.
1	One thing I don't want is to start this endless discussion all over again.
1	Why did you take him then with me?
1	We will sue your asses.
1	You wicked boy.
1	So, come on, give me the gun.
1	I can't afford a fuckin' dream house!
1	It was self-defence, for Christ's sake!
1	I don't need a doctor. I need a promoter.
1	In a shootout, five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals, the Jamaican Voodoo Posse, who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of...
1	Tommy, why did you bring him here?
1	You put your head in the sand.
1	Wait a minute!
1	Shut up!
1	Lawrence? No, we are a gang without money.
1	This ain't your personal little war, you know.
1	Satan's spirit flew right out of my TV set And into my soul.
1	Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
1	Don't fight, Joe.
1	The military that uses the war machines and justifies them, and then the intelligence community that is not really an intelligence community, it's a covert operations community, armed with military weapons and nuclear weapons, and that they're trying to push the boundaries now
1	I know him. She knows him.
1	Burglars!
1	Get out of my way.
1	Fuck the office!
1	You want to come into this house, you ring the damn bell!
1	Can't you go in there and say something?
1	Don't tell me I did that!
1	The only thing you'll get from me is this.
1	Stop arguing!
1	To have an ugly incident occur while we're on this train with no method of escape that is not in our self-interest, either.
1	Shoot her now.
1	You ought to be shown up.
1	Enter!
1	I said part of me"."
1	Drive!
1	I got my shotgun full of 16,thin dimes.
1	Sit down, we were worried about you.
1	The first time I ask you to do one thing for me, like rob a train...
1	Son of a bitch.
1	There will be no liberty for three months.
1	A woman who drinks is bad enough and I will not stand for a woman cursing and blaspheming God.
1	That's twice you've let me down, kid.
1	I told you it was hot.
1	Smash everything! Rip it, tear it, rip it...
1	I ain't gonna be a nobody.
1	If I had a Luger...
1	The word is bitch.
1	You stay out of this!
1	The last time this witch went to a party, she made the princess prick her finger with a spindle and fall asleep for  years.
1	However many questions you ask, you never expect an answer.
1	Cool it! Or you're gonna get the same thing your boyfriend got.
1	Do you expect me to believe this?
1	Why would a rival biker gang crash a bar full of Vagos?
1	This thing isn't here for decoration.
1	I said no!
1	A perfect place to lose anybody, but this little doll's our cover story.
1	Joe, I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client.
1	How would you like the holy hell kicked out of you?
1	What you did to me all those years ago.
1	They were sailors, same as me... Slaughtered by that monster You're tryin' to make friends with.
1	Damn!
1	Cody, please! You must listen!
1	Dante, you're going too fast.
1	So what's your problem?
1	You people can either help me, or stay the hell out of my way.
1	Excuse me, I'm looking for a man.
1	I'm going to destroy all of you evil monks
1	One more to go, chicken.
1	And this spic, Valentin, what a fucking nut case.
1	I said pay him!
1	Polhemus was bad news.
1	Give him a break, would you?
1	She ought to be melted down for razor blades.
1	Cover up her mouth!
1	No, thanks, I almost died once already today.
1	Where'd he touch you, boy?
1	I hate them.
1	You're out of your mind. - The prosecutor will explain everything when you see him.
1	Out of my court before I order your arrest!
1	The fleet didn't order us to manoeuvre at discretion.
1	That'll be all, steward.
1	Get her.
1	Honestly, Graham. What is the matter with you tonight?
1	I won't have this conversation carried on by the children.
1	That's what foxes me.
1	Harvey, there's no way the DA handles a case like this himself just because I work for you.
1	I don't need entertaining.
1	Quiet!
1	You know, the four fragile fingers, and the long arm, real short joint.
1	She will! You're listening to a sick girl!
1	Stripped of all that it's no wonder they become suicidal.
1	What did this boy do that frogface didn't do? Johnny, I want to talk to you.
1	They won't care about one girl when thousands die every day.
1	What the fuck?
1	Her husband has a beer one night... Doesn't even comment on the glass.
1	Why didn't you tell me before?
1	She's my child too.
1	I didn't like him anyway.
1	She'll never make another picture.
1	I am glad that Senator Portman is calm, because every once in a while I'm ready to do a McCain on these guys.
1	Either you take care of yourself or I, too, shall resign.
1	He'll take orders all right.
1	Yeah, I'm aware of that. And they have all of them.
1	I have to take a bus.
1	Why don't you just let us get on with our job?
1	I don't need you monitoring my intake.
1	Do something!
1	We'll be in touch.
1	Vamos!
1	Don't change the station.
1	Are you crazy?
1	When have you had a date?
1	Son of a bitch!
1	The day before she did that terrible thing to me.
1	That's enough of that.
1	I put my ass on the line for nothing!
1	You want a baby-sitter?
1	Maybe she even killed my partner, Chris Amador.
1	Why don't you leave me alone when I'm sleeping?
1	Shit.
1	My grandfather wouldn't have anything to do with him.
1	Just kiss my ass from now on.
1	We can't feed the Russian people on your intentions.
1	I object to you coming here.
1	I'm not afraid of you.
1	You'll never take my child out of this house.
1	Don't imagine things, Ellie.
1	I command it!
1	You saw that coming, did you?
1	I wish they'd both go out.
1	So what?
1	And let me remind you, we lost two key PA's in one day.
1	You can't come in.
1	What are you trying to do to me?
1	Hell, I guess so. You guess so. Well, that's beautiful.
1	Are you listening?
1	Yeah, yeah, I got the horse all picked out to buy the... we actually reached this turn in the road.
1	It's Oextry I want to see squirm.
1	Go home!
1	Don't you dare.
1	Oh yeah? You wanna tell me why?
1	Busted.
1	You knew that file didn't have a damn thing to do with my case.
1	Close the hatch!
1	Maybe you should have let Mother make her own choice.
1	Dad, will you teach me how to fight?
1	Stop fidgeting.
1	You've been served.
1	Is it true?
1	You'll stump to Tokyo with the rest of us.
1	A dead man has one half-hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
1	Don't question my decisions again.
1	What the fuck are you doing in my office?
1	I'm not getting paid to be undercover, so I work at this garage all day.
1	Just some water, dude.
1	If that's humor, don't bother.
1	I'll tell you why I'm calling.
1	Shut up! - I want out of here.
1	I don't give a shit if he knows who killed him or not.
1	Do you have to cheat at everything?
1	You're a liar!
1	Keep your men here!
1	Get these men out of here.
1	I'm rich enough.
1	Get down!
1	Shut up! And take those dresses off!
1	No, get away from her you fucking old bitch!
1	What the fuck man?
1	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel.
1	Did you plant the bug?
1	I can't believe it!
1	We got 'em again!
1	Have you a sales force, or are you still relying on divine intervention?
1	Oh, now, look what you've done!
1	Don't sit down.
1	Oh tots, I'll keep that in mind.
1	It's wonderful to feel her throat crush under your arm.
1	We need to talk.
1	You hear me?
1	Why have you no hangover?
1	I slaved for you for over ten years without even a raise or a promotion.
1	Your father wears tight underwear! And I can't stand your mother! Your father wears tight underwear!
1	Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
1	Don't need anybody right now.
1	I'm not surprised. Me, too.
1	Well, I don't want it.
1	Ask him what money, asshole.
1	Don't you have any idea where you're going?
1	What do I care about your philosophy of the soldier?
1	He's such a little man.
1	I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow.
1	Shit! Graham's got a streamer!
1	Would you stop harrassing her? But if you'll let me point out that my client's mental state...
1	I will, if you don't stop nagging me.
1	They making it tough on you?
1	You can't land here without written permission!
1	I wouldn't want anybody to think I wasn't hospitable.
1	Get back!
1	What the hell do you think that I do?
1	Pay attention to me.
1	Ha ha ha! This is it, America! The event you've all been waiting for.
1	Get up! Do you hear me?
1	You're going into the arena alone.
1	Who in the world can do that?
1	He hit me.
1	You see murder! You see guts!
1	I won't take it!
1	It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or, you can see all of the evidence and you cannot feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right.
1	Too long.
1	She said I stabbed that son of a bitch plenty of times."
1	I'm clearing out of that office everything I own.
1	It'll make you cry.
1	You made a big mistake, Burkhardt.
1	Why should I answer?
1	I'm not concerned to hear your reasons, man.
1	You'll never deceive the people again!
1	By Molto. No discussion. Interview.
1	We didn't win because Evan Smith has video of Donna in their offices.
1	You won't get away with this, Trixie.
1	Enjoying the party, Captain Torrey?
1	Well, why didn't I know about that?
1	There's no change in it, is there?
1	Why you raising' up a lady's hopes like that?
1	You've promised to think about it.
1	She'd come back, soaked to the skin, but always with the same excuse:
1	Do I have to find out for yourself?
1	Besides, I have to go to the goddamn senior honours dinner tonight.
1	There's no need for you to try and scare us, Mr. Buchanan.
1	You say you're sorry and we'll let you go.
1	Come on. Are we doing this again?
1	Then why the hell are we here?
1	Francis! Pay the guy, will you?
1	They have the opposing counsel's secretary poking around in their goddamn file room.
1	All right, what is it if I may ask, You do want to do?
1	We're going to... -, get out of there!
1	Don't you think I know it?
1	Bringin' her home in the middle of the night wouldn't help anybody, especially her.
1	And stop fidgeting.
1	If you have something to say, shout it!
1	Bring him.
1	You big pussy!
1	Speak up or I'll shoot.
1	I require an answer.
1	And I'll have every gunboat in the Navy hunting' ole Nemo.
1	If I don't get a room, you and your hotel are fourth on my list to be sued!
1	I'm not blind.
1	Am I okay? Everybody's worried sick about you.
1	Old man, give me the keys!
1	What's the deal here? You used to work here or something?
1	We ain't forgetting who you are!
1	What's the matter with you two?
1	Raymond knew he was taking bribes?
1	Are you telling me he's carrying a. and a.?
1	We already know that
1	You're gonna even that out, aren't you?
1	What's your interest in this?
1	Leave me alone!
1	Well. I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
1	Why don't you shut the hell up! Crybaby.
1	Eric, come on, damn it!
1	Hit him!
1	Honey, I'm trying to read.
1	Get away from that wood!
1	Even if it could be your involvement with drugs has vindicated me.
1	You dirty rat.
1	Give me some information. Something. Anything!
1	We already searched your apartment thoroughly.
1	Are you kidding?
1	No!
1	Where's Graham? Who cares?
1	Every time I run into you, you tell me whatever shady thing just went down was about the greater good or that it didn't happen, or this, that, or the other.
1	You expect us to stand all the way?
1	No, stay there. You must stay.
1	I'm so pissed at you! I'm really pissed, OK?
1	You're a fool, you're bagged-out with sauce.
1	This is no time for jokes.
1	Then you'll have to have permission.
1	I didn't ask you, Orr.
1	Enough with the water.
1	Goddamn it, do something.
1	I can't do that, Vinnie.
1	If it were our plane, it'd be crashing.
1	Fucking bitch!
1	You think I was born yesterday?
1	Get going, Coopersmith! Vinnie!
1	I also have a memory.
1	Give me the lighter.
1	Give me the money.
1	I hate this river.
1	You aren't one of them, are you?
1	Be that as it may, it is a loan.
1	I'm gonna save your ass.
1	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
1	I'm gonna love squeezing you out.
1	I don't want any more of it.
1	Did ya? There was a razorback in my truck!
1	Somebody moved it.
1	You throw double sixes again, and I'll have you burned for a witch.
1	You were unavailable for consultation.
1	I'm waiting.
1	Stop. I've been told. We're gonna look into it.
1	Why don't you run on home, or you'll get hurt worse than before, [GAY SLUR].
1	The bastard Hu betrayed us
1	Yes? What is it?
1	Don't bother.
1	You think I'm dumb enough to give myself up to the T-men?
1	What are you all gaping at?
1	I'm gonna force them into their room, grab their stuff, point the gun in their faces.
1	You're in no condition to discuss it.
1	I'll get even with you. I'll get even with you.
1	Will you get that freaking nut job off my back?
1	I hope you lose.
1	You better start reforming, Cyril.
1	I'm tired of being pawed.
1	Can't you walk faster?
1	Poor little rich boy.""
1	Oh, I think not.
1	He attacked your bitch.
1	It doomed me forever to middle management, and that's the truth.
1	You'll need more than just two of us.
1	You're gonna die.
1	Kill that cat, Kid.
1	Take your flight.
1	Back down! -All right, all right, all right.
1	Who do you think you are butting in like this?
1	What the fuck are they doing in there?
1	When are you gonna fight a real fighter?
1	We were robbed!
1	If you don't get married, I'll fire the both of you.
1	You're gonna regret this!
1	What you have done?
1	That charlatan! That hypocrite!
1	This can't go on, it's ridiculous.
1	Bring my gun when you come back!
1	You think you're the only guy in this paw that wants out?
1	You know, maybe it's better you're not staying here.
1	Some people never learn.
1	Monsters devouring human flesh.
1	No, you're not listening to me!
1	Bury them for 24,hours, give me time!
1	You know, you-you could get hurt. You shouldn't go around robbing people. You could go to jail.
1	If you lay a hand on her...
1	Next time, I'll wipe 'em on you.
1	You better carry that around with you all the time.
1	We don't like him.
1	My wife doesn't have to answer those questions.
1	Grimm, I'm thinking of the baby!
1	Give us a statement! Dozens are dead.
1	Well, how do you think that I make ends meet with your father Gallivanting off to Mexico?
1	What's the matter with you two?
1	Hans waved me off.
1	For God's sake, June!
1	Promise me that you are not a spy, and then I will make you a promise in return.
1	If you think about getting cute I'll blow that shit you call brains all over my partner here.
1	What an idiot.
1	An executive order...
1	No matter how many you kill here you still won't save the kingdom The emperor is surrounded by sycophants and has no idea of the suffering of his people
1	This can't go on, it's ridiculous.
1	Either he falls in line or I'll break him so open they won't find the pieces.
1	You're wasting yourself on this kid, then hanging us up for nothing.
1	But you make one slip, just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage.
1	What? Get off my coat!
1	Put this on, and for the love of God,
1	I could have you shot.
1	What do I have to do? Grow up.
1	You never stood a chance.
1	If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...
1	And how do you know that?
1	Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances.
1	Hello. - Never, ever pick up the phone.
1	Drop that cannon.
1	Why didn't you think of that?
1	Surprise, surprise.
1	Shit food!
1	She's always in the bathroom!
1	You've overlooked several other important details.
1	I'm also perfectly willing and able to cancel this entire production right now, and pay you off and write you off.
1	Did you hear me?
1	Elder, if you have something to say, just say it
1	If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out.
1	Cease fire!
1	Where the hell do you think you're going?
1	So far you haven't given us any information
1	Let me out of this glory hole!
1	You're still in FBI custody.
1	You must never do anything like that again, ever.
1	There may be subs out there, maybe not.
1	You'll never take my child out of this house.
1	You took him!
1	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle, what is it?
1	What's that got to do with a train?
1	No, stop it.
1	Oh, know how to count!
1	You can't come to my magic show.
1	He'll take orders all right.
1	Sir, you have beaten my wife, and she has gone off with another man.
1	Junior when are you going to learn the difference between a rock and a nose?
1	Let him back in, Nick, now.
1	For God's sakes, put yourself in my position.
1	Oh, please send her in.
1	I won't vote on it until I get my questions answered.
1	That's what you're always talking about, helping other people out!
1	OK, but it's the last time I set foot in this house.
1	I mean, Diane would always stick a matchbook under one leg to remind me that I'd measured wrong, but she never got rid of it.
1	Fine mess you got me into.
1	He accused me of selling out.
1	You've done it again, and I'm responsible.
1	I'll give you a minute and  seconds.
1	I don't claim to be some kind of brilliant psychologist.
1	I'm talking about you.
1	What the hell are we supposed to do with these?
1	But hair just keeps on sprouting.
1	If you don't, somebody else will.
1	Why don't you keep out of this?
1	What do you mean you didn't see?
1	, ...
1	!
1	Don't come in!
1	From here on, your education must continue in the school of war.
1	You're gonna drink it all, Seth Dove, even if it takes all night!
1	I can't stand it here any longer.
1	You have no right.
1	She had been very abused.
1	There can be no quarreling here.
1	The devil with him!
1	Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life!
1	You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
1	You want to give her another shot at him?
1	Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.
1	I'm gonna leave.
1	What are you jerking me around for?
1	Of course. You're a big supporter of my opponent.
1	They described a decades long conspiracy to cover up extraterrestrial visitation to Earth.
1	And what makes you think that note would interest me?
1	Whaddya trying' to do, make it a short day?
1	Fine.
1	Some things you just don't tell anybody.
1	I did not ask your advice.
1	I told you not to come into the lobby.
1	I'm gonna take the gag out.
1	Look, don't blame us because the warship shelled you.
1	I object to you coming here.
1	Oh, no. That won't do.
1	Now get out there and cook!
1	I'm not afraid of you.
1	Come on! You're gonna break your guitar. Come on.
1	Respond.
1	I shall not translate.
1	Excuse me...
1	Hurry!
1	Or did you think to find me grown gray completely?
1	You'll not take her while I live!
1	It wasn't up to my mother.
1	You're dead, you sons of bitches.
1	And now they've lost it.
1	You can't come in.
1	Well, for starters, you can give me an update.
1	Young lady, would you pull down your dress? Sure.
1	I gotta hang up now because I gotta go kill everybody, okay?
1	It's the blood, bone and sinew of this democracy that great men handed down to the human race!
1	I want the whole morning edition a blast to push him off the floor.
1	I don't care if you fire me this exact fucking moment.
1	Motherfucker.
1	You have to have enough imagination to visualize the crime.
1	Old man, my last name isn't Chow!
1	Hell, we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket! How's that?
1	You run into him on the daisy chain you tell him I want to see him. Comprende?
1	Save the jokes. He wants to see you.
1	The reason Congress enacted Section  in the first place was because of a lawsuit filed by Stratton Oakmont, the boiler-room securities operation founded by Jordan Belfort, better known as The Wolf of Wall Street.
1	I don't give a damn.
1	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1	I'm not kiddin' around.
1	If you officers know what's good for you, tell them to stop.
1	Send your cops home then.
1	OK. All right. You win.
1	If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
1	No! No!
1	We, the hunted, will now hunt!
1	Put the gun away.
1	No!
1	I'm not gonna fire you.
1	Shit!
1	Even in one of yours, I would have thrown this glass at him.
1	You'll go too far.
1	You'll stay here without food or water until you talk.
1	I shall live and he shall die.
1	You'd better tell your friends, too.
1	We can't cover for him, Gibbs.
1	I hate the British!
1	Bastards.
1	Is that why you hate them so much?
1	I'm not lying.
1	What's he got to do with this thing?
1	Close your mouth, dear.
1	You mean, a little kid kinda boy?
1	You can't guarantee our luggage!
1	Dad!
1	Of course.
1	I'm not concerned to hear your reasons, man.
1	You've been told.
1	Look, I ain't no snitch, but the reason me and Jake don't speak no more is because I told him he went too far with that.
1	Is it unfair?
1	Sephardic.
1	I'm gonna speak to your ma!
1	You're a fool.
1	Nah, I just stick to weed now.
1	I'll make friends and enemies to please myself.
1	Don't raise your voice to me.
1	Martin, don't press it this time.
1	Any of you guys call me Francis, and I'll kill you.
1	You're forcing us to take action against you.
1	If the rights of the individual are not respected by the group, the group cannot exist.
1	I'll tell you, two out of three of those judges do not use the internet.
1	If you want to cite law, then obey it yourself.
1	We can't feed the Russian people on your intentions.
1	And if you don't take me to my hotel, that means I have to walk.
1	Punch him, Cam!
1	You'll not take her while I live!
1	You want to know what a real criminal is, Sarah?
1	Do you have to cheat at everything?
1	What the hels going on?"
1	You're a liar.
1	If they does, I'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again!
1	It was disapproved of by the Party.
1	You've cost me millions and millions of francs.
1	I thought we had an understanding.
1	Oh God, what a mess.
1	It's your decision, but if you make it you'll be no good to yourself or anybody else.
1	I won the damn title and they think I'm a bum!
1	You're as bad as your sister, coming home from work at all hours and colours.
1	Keep your mouth shut!
1	He wasn't a boy, he was seventeen.
1	Get out of here!
1	For if I'm not physician, how is it I know that you're a dying man?
1	I could ask you the same question.
1	Please, don't let him do it!
1	Take your hands off!
1	Why don't you just get out of here.
1	In spite of glasnost, my friend's novel cannot yet be published... in the Soviet Union.
1	You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of international law.
1	You don't get it, do you?
1	He's taken it again!
1	Some day you can punch out your pop.
1	Let's try it again. Oh, come on.
1	What the hell are you doing?
1	Pull yourself together and I'll let you go.
1	By stepping on a bottle and breaking the heel of my shoe!
1	I was thinking that everyone that played a part in the damage to my child should be held responsible.
1	But you don't hear me complaining.
1	They breed like rabbits, don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on Sutton Place.
1	Oi!
1	I have to come all this way to tell you this?
1	Shut up.
1	If you have any last words, say them now.
1	No, I don't even want to do that.
1	I don't believe you!
1	Probably not.
1	What's keeping you?
1	Silence, Willoughby!
1	Snap out of it! He took my Eben!
1	I would not like to have my mother with me.
1	What the fuck takes a week?
1	And the last time you were in my office, you told me you hadn't committed a crime to get the job done.
1	So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet.
1	How do you plan to pass if you're too busy stealing cars And shooting black people?
1	What do you know about this?
1	I hate this frigging place.
1	You're breaking my fucking arm! - Hurry!
1	So, are you going to tell the police?
1	Shoot her.
1	What then?
1	I'm not interested in your opinion.
1	Did you really think he would come with you?
1	Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable.
1	That people would go and do that!
1	There's no more running.
1	Turn me loose and get out.
1	You'll make no calls.
1	He told me they're getting cold feet.
1	Do you question my word?
1	You know how long l've been looking for you, you spic fink?
1	Why were his fingerprints all over that goddamn glass?
1	Shit.
1	Storm the bastille!
1	I don't care if we got it!
1	Please don't say that.
1	Well, I never said that.
1	No?
1	But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles. -
1	Why do You have to make everything so bloody difficult?
1	We don't want speeches.
1	Hold it.
1	Get out.
1	Your idea of a chance at him was uncorroborated statements from an informant who was doing hard time and who would sell his own mother to get his sentence reduced.
1	My clothes!
1	Ask him!
1	I know you don't mean any harm, but you are in everyone's way.
1	What do you care?
1	You'll just have time to change.
1	Hurry!
1	Your little playmate's gone, and I suggest we do the same.
1	He's sure gonna bear down on me.
1	Sergei is no friend.
1	Don't walk away from me.
1	WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?
1	I wish I was.
1	Nothing ever really dies in the House.
1	They never have and they never will.
1	And you agree?
1	They are against you, and against me.
1	You know what? It doesn't even matter. Because I'm taking over.
1	Nothing we didn't expect.
1	No!
1	I knew you'd come. I was... I was waiting!
1	You can't leave me with Ma!
1	That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it.
1	You idiot.
1	There's nothing more commercial than a long-shot comeback of a down-on-his-luck underdog.
1	What the hell do you want?
1	Is there anything you want to tell us?
1	Get upstairs, miss.
1	You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say.
1	Aw, I'll do what I damn well please.
1	I'll brain that guy.
1	Seriously, must you keep your bicycle in the hall, Father Benoît?
1	Ruuuuuth!
1	Who killed the music?
1	No! By God, you may not!
1	You see what he did to Miss Cochran's shirt?
1	Just leave him alone!
1	I won't take it!
1	And there's not a damn thing you can do about it, you understand me?
1	Move and I'll slit your throat!
1	Go and say sorry to him.'
1	Why do you hate everybody?
1	You're a fucking dead man!
1	Even if I were wearing a wire, this noise would wreck the tape.
1	When that monster makes a run for it tonight, you'll be in deep trouble
1	Why should I answer?
1	Don't make me shoot you.
1	I'm not deciding for you.
1	We don't have to give you a cent.
1	God, it was bright.
1	Okay, look, the last thing we knew, she was getting on that helicopter.
1	I live in a fucking bed-sit.
1	I didn't say that.
1	You'll never get me to give this up!
1	You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
1	For once in my life, I'm telling--
1	You'll beat me but you'll go down, Mike.
1	Set us free!
1	Stay there and don't move!
1	I'm not interested in what you think.
1	Things'll be different when Cameron gets back.
1	You won't get my approval on this.
1	They put all this nonsense into his brain.
1	Why didn't you help me?
1	If you ever had a sense of humor. When you finish testifying,
1	The Feds are at the lake house, man.
1	Ok, kids, dinner's almost ready! Turn off the TV!
1	You should have learned by now!
1	Well, you did Dale, you stuck it up there,
1	How did you not disclose this, Terry?
1	That's not for you to say.
1	He hates everybody.
1	You're always taking me out to the summerhouse!
1	He's a prick.
1	The job isn't mine yet, Leslie.
1	Our agenda"?"
1	Fine!
1	Son of dork, son of dork!
1	She's my child too.
1	I will not go back where I came from, because I do not like it there.
1	Why don't you both shut up?
1	What? That I'm your little puppet?
1	So leave us alone and anybody who wants it gets it.
1	Smack him in the face!
1	Try me.
1	The dog's mine to kill, an eye for an eye.
1	Who you trying to kid, sister?
1	Do not be foolish!
1	There's no question. I'm not going with you.
1	And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there.
1	I don't believe you. - You can't accuse me, sir.
1	I'd like to go home.
1	What are you accusing me of?
1	How long will you be able to keep the litigation going on your own resources?
1	You can't take the car!
1	What could possibly be the matter?
1	You want to kill yourself... fine with me.
1	You've got to stop!
1	Skinny popped him.
1	I told you not to pick up the phone.
1	Coward!
1	She busted out in a Vegas faro game.
1	Presumably you haven't done much betting, since you've only been wrong once in your life. Twice.
1	My father hates him. My wife hates him.
1	Don't kid yourself.
1	We don't like Razinin.
1	What are you talking about?
1	The boy won't give me the eagle.
1	Quick! Quick!
1	If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.
1	You threatened her if she told me.
1	You've gone out of your mind.
1	Set us free!
1	Shit!
1	Drop it, okay?
1	Freeze!
1	We have diddly-shit.
1	* So get up out of your bed
1	They're not putting up the money.
1	You knew nothing about DeVriess and you know even less about Queeg.
1	Hustled her off in a chopper.
1	Do not try to skip!
1	No.
1	Well, I don't give a damn about the reason.
1	I was bored to death.
1	We." Who the hell are "we"?"
1	Lousy bitch.
1	Do not talk about that son of a bitch.
1	I am warning about you, John,
1	Where are you going, man? - I was gonna sit-- I'm gonna sit down.
1	Stop it! You even helped carry the chest out, you liar.
1	The door swings both ways, my ass.
1	Probably not, hon, but somebody else's folks will be... all that sand to brush off.
1	She's not going to, so what difference does it make?
1	Cut the shit.
1	Say it, then, and get out!
1	We expected you to come in here with a plan.
1	Stop!
1	Stop mumbling.
1	Spoil what?
1	Bitch!
1	Doctor's here to examine you, freak just so no one can say we laid one finger on you.
1	Come on! Come on! -No!
1	Stop!
1	I'm not coming in there!
1	You'll regret this!
1	You're forcing us to take action against you.
1	I hate him so fucking much.
1	Mother of God. Hawkins' dog? - You said pig.
1	Get out!
1	Who took the Scotch from my closet?
1	We ain't never been friends.
1	He missed the turn.
1	What's the matter with you, Liz?
1	My heart is weak, and I'm too old.
1	We don't tolerate nudity in any shape or form.
1	Get out of my way!
1	We know where you live.
1	Are you telling me I don't know what a shark looks like?
1	We already know the rest.
1	You're gonna get my babies killed!
1	What's your interest in this?
1	Get the fuck back!
1	If you don't give me my $200, I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it and he'll make you give it to me, 'cause it's mine.
1	You knew when I point blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.
1	Were you in them riots?
1	You'd better listen to what he said.
1	Wet it with tears, bleed on it, Egan.
1	I've saved you guys from big junk collars, traced lost stuff, fingered stools.
1	You feel qualified?
1	Have you thought for a moment about her?
1	Shit!
1	You... bitch!
1	Uh, off message throughout.
1	Why don't you shut up and go back where you came from?
1	We needed to see what you were capable of, Francis, and I've a family to protect.
1	You've no right to do it to him.
1	I don't see why my son shouldn't be getting his own allowance.
1	When were you going to give the money to the community?
1	Honey, please don't stand like that.
1	We're seven minutes behind schedule.
1	I'm against it.
1	I hate when you do that.
1	You dirty rat.
1	Up yours!
1	There's just this one hammer.
1	Give me that!
1	We also escaped with the million pounds of somebody else's money.
1	I don't want the money if this is how you have to earn it!
1	If they let me settle this now, between me and Brennan they're never going to see or hear from me again.
1	I mean, isn't that enough?
1	You took away my czar, my country, my people.
1	There's not enough bleach to burn the stench of you away, Luke Dove.
1	You come from somewhere and you're trying to make nothing out of yours.
1	I want the truth now, no flannel.
1	She's with me now, whitebread.
1	What then?
1	You said the party's over.
1	You're over.
1	Don't you think I know how you plan to get out?
1	You have a first name, haven't you?
1	He might win a few fights, but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
1	Dear Senator, have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed?
1	Whether I call you Hsiao-tsing or Windy there's no need to be bashful
1	Can't do what?
1	My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain.
1	I want them to pay for it.
1	Look, I gotta go.
1	Give it up.
1	Well, you never even asked me why I was going.
1	You'll be told after you sail.
1	Why are you laughing?
1	I don't want to hear another word.
1	I'm gonna put a stop to this.
1	Told you not to call me that.
1	Don't be rummaging through my private documents, Marcus.
1	You're a hard man to kill, Admiral.
1	Then, firm!
1	I didn't ask you.
1	Yes, I want you must call the My husband's family.
1	Why are you looking at me?
1	Because I'm still tired.
1	Well, screw the British.
1	Jerry!
1	Congratulations, Rock...
1	We'll blow it open.
1	Goddamn it!
1	What's that got to do with us?
1	Come on, honey.
1	You pretend to raise money for the little league, and the whole community should lighten up?
1	I'll make it right with you.
1	What about ten commendations for valour and the best felony arrest record in the history of this department?
1	Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!
1	I should hate to interrupt my present work.
1	It's a background check.
1	This truck was coming right at me.
1	It's a matter of life and death!
1	You've no right to do it to him.
1	Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.
1	Get off me! Get off me!
1	When I was in the corps, I was olive drab, or camouflage, or dress blues or whatever was the fucking uniform of the day.
1	Come off a rumble, we'd beat the shit out of a gang.
1	I would like to protest the counsel's twisting of words.
1	Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but you might get yourself arrested on federal charges if you don't stop what you're doing.
1	Keep to your seat.
1	That isn't enough.
1	I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend, we're here at this camp selling ourselves.
1	We don't need you here!
1	Give me the suit, right now.
1	We can do better than that.
1	You asked for second helpings.
1	Explain yourself.
1	I want to get away from you cops and wops and junkies.
1	Adrian, where's the kid?
1	There's no fucking handle!
1	Because she can't stand him!
1	Did you bring that guy in here?
1	But Lawrence never speaks with me, it will be possible to avoid it.
1	Why would she come here at all?
1	Out of the question.
1	Shall I go?
1	Well, that broke that up.
1	And these people in the union are smarter than what they used to be.
1	Well, I never said that.
1	We weren't even there very long, and I had to buy all those darn dresses.
1	The psycho-vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder.
1	Relax.
1	And you're shocked because I took credit for your idea.
1	You know the rules about smoking.
1	Between the cousins and neighbors, there were  kids, always causing trouble together.
1	Put him in my custody right now!
1	Who says? - It's just so, Kim!
1	There's no cause for temper, child.
1	No, you mustn't!
1	This is my show. I'm calling the shots.
1	Come on, Tommy.
1	Uh... Yes? No offense, but I think
1	What the hell you doing?
1	Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself
1	What a jerk.
1	Have enough respect for me not to lie.
1	Get me a prisoner, understand?
1	That is hardly for you to decide.
1	Go back to your work.
1	Now! Natural, huh? You on your back, huh?
1	You think it's a good idea to hand me an ax right now?
1	Don't tell me that you're above temptation.
1	You're jealous that I have Auryn, and you've come to take it from me.
1	Pull yourself up.
1	Then if you ain't my pa, I want my $200!
1	Bit dicey.
1	I hope you're not implying that the caucus shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.
1	Hands up!
1	You'll never be sorry.
1	Looks like a fucking choirboy.
1	And very heavily.
1	Really. - Am I no longer allowed to give gifts?
1	Why didn't you tell me about you and Carolyn?
1	You touch White Buffalo again and I'll kill you.
1	What's all this interference?
1	Gimme that damn mike!
1	No, I'm serious.
1	How much simpler it would be, for so many of us, if Kirk Edwards had not found it necessary to look for a new face.
1	He could go anytime. - Move. Move!
1	Nice going, asshole!
1	The fact that you don't drink at all, Kirk, is the greatest argument for drunkenness I know.
1	What are you calling me Joe for?
1	Will you let go of me!
1	I don't gotta pay you for that.
1	We'd just started boarding when this happened.
1	Cannot your brother help?
1	Fuck you!
1	Oh, it's your fault she's gone June,
1	Hey, you two with the mileage upgrades, sit down.
1	Fuck it!
1	It hurts!
1	You've taken advantage of my wife.
1	I told you, he didn't even know I was going to do it.
1	What are you trying to say?
1	No one wants to fly with you.
1	Left!
1	Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch  flies a day. And that they should be collected, counted and delivered daily, by me.
1	Come on. Go, just go.
1	If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you.
1	Kirk, Maria has made a chump out of you.
1	You're here to repent your sins, is it?
1	That's what's the matter with you.
1	Take your hands off me!
1	First you waste my time, then you get my name wrong!
1	Stay back!
1	We, the hunted, will now hunt!
1	You will live to regret this day.
1	I think you'd better go away.
1	When did you get a chance to do this, kid?
1	You're hanging your ass out a good long way on this one.
1	You'll sell the furniture?
1	Does anything ever happen here?
1	You stay away from my baby.
1	What you're dealing with is over your head.
1	Three's hardly an army.
1	Damn it, shut up!
1	Burn this!
1	She's not really thinking...
1	You know, ten Colombians and Scorpios armed to fuck all.
1	There's a lot of things she could ask me but she won't say one darn word.
1	Can't you humor him? I need a favor.
1	Well, somebody's gonna have to start trusting somebody.
1	A guy that's talking about he's gonna solve all your problems.
1	Environmentalists call it a disaster.
1	It's not a matter I want to discuss, I tell you.
1	I said we're closed, Bozo.
1	I chew up you fucking wise guys and spit out [GAY SLUR]!
1	Yeah? The last time you assured me, I lost good men in the Kola Peninsula.
1	If you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have planned the whole thing.
1	You fucking double-crossing gringo pig bastard!
1	Nancy, please!
1	We can't have that.
1	That's unacceptable.
1	You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that.
1	She never cared about me!
1	No, Your Majesty!
1	There's your answer, professor.
1	You know, you're expecting too much from that formula of B-4, Mr Oxly.
1	You stay out of this.
1	The masses love to worship their idols
1	You better start reforming, Cyril.
1	We don't like him.
1	You could have alerted us!
1	[GAY SLUR].
1	I do declare, it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah-ing.
1	Stop the presses!
1	Hey, trust me with your life but not your money or your wife. You're an asshole!
1	My wife went to a lot of trouble.
1	Grow, cuz.
1	Give us the f...
1	Well, how else was I supposed to get Bethany to come home?
1	Just stay out of this.
1	I mean, it was rather unprofessional on her part.
1	His Majesty is very demanding.
1	That to marry Maria would be the most senselessly cruel and destructive thing you will ever have done?
1	Don't show it to me.
1	Bullshit.
1	You mess with him, we mess with you!
1	What are you driving at?
1	Yeah, I mind.
1	Hands up!
1	That's not true.
1	You know the rules about smoking.
1	Hans, why do you keep on making trouble for us?
1	Why not believe me?
1	They'll never believe us.
1	Why are you doing this to yourself?
1	Stop!
1	If not, get the fuck off my car!
1	Stop!
1	And just what do you want me to do?
1	I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
1	I don't wanna have a stinkin' fight again.
1	I need you to tell me where Theresa Rubel is. Theresa Rubel.
1	I will kill you!
1	Elder...
1	You were too rough the last time!
1	None of our business.
1	He ain't gonna get my hide.
1	I ain't talking about that crap!
1	But if you do not work hard you will be punished.
1	Come on, get on.
1	Why don't you shut the fuck up?
1	Judgement of murder!
1	The Navy can't do without me here, the island might sink!
1	I shot him.
1	Fine. Actually, perfect.
1	Dear Senator, have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed?
1	That low-life was in here last night.
1	Do people think I'm a carbon copy or a second-rate pretender who only got a shot because of my skin tone?""
1	But there's no support for this appealing idea.
1	Tell them to open the door!
1	Borden continued to invade your privacy.
1	Mind your own business.
1	Fuck him.
1	Because I want to.
1	I told you to not let them out of your sight!
1	These darn things are heavy!
1	I'm just tired.
1	If I call you up in the middle of the night, tell you to come over and screw my old lady while I watch, what are you gonna do?
1	Get out!
1	The World ls Going Up In Flames")"
1	Well, that broke that up.
1	You mind your own business.
1	I want every one of them out of here.
1	I had trouble getting back to the sub.
1	Motherfuckers!
1	I'm going to Martinique with a million bucks taped to my butt unless you keep screwing around, in which case, we'll all go to jail.
1	It's on the map as being here.
1	Go home!
1	After that, I don't care if you've found the Holy Grail.
1	If you have any last words, say them now.
1	I don't think I'm tired. - Oh, I think you are.
1	Stop it!
1	Of course you know I'm in no danger.
1	Can you explain your testimony that there is more stringent posting rules for selling a motorcycle than selling a -year-old?
1	Because I did not want in your life.
1	You have destroyed our refuge.
1	Give it to me!
1	What the fuck are you doing with those?
1	No, I told you I don't wanna do that anymore.
1	You're annoying me.
1	And Christine, she won't help me to solve them.
1	You go to the embassy!
1	What the hell does this all mean?
1	I won't be made a fool of.
1	Fuck you, Nick.
1	That's how it works.
1	Why don't you just hit me in the head with a hammer?
1	I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. You're in danger.
1	Quiet!
1	I have defeated you?
1	Those wicked detectives...
1	I really don't care if you're the law or whatever the fuck you are.
1	I have no fucking idea why they towed it.
1	I asked you never to speak to me again.
1	And I'll see you in court in three weeks.
1	I don't care about Prager!
1	Shut up!
1	After them...slowly!
1	And it is time that the United States government started coming clean on what it's all about, because they're very important military and...
1	You're just spoiled. You've thrown everything away.
1	You can't do that to him.
1	Now that's... not a great deal of effort for more money than you ever dreamed of. And no risk... no risk to you at all.
1	No.
1	Where in the hell is justice?
1	I mean, jeez...
1	Bitch!
1	I told you I'd get those pearls tonight, didn't I?
1	I've got to get up.
1	There's a lot too much going on.
1	And he waded in there with a lead pipe and he saved your ass and now you're going to deny him over his dead body?
1	He's with them.
1	It's not mine. Do you still claim you have an identical scarf?
1	Don't mess around with it, and it won't mess with you.
1	What do you want?
1	Leave us the hell alone!
1	What's the matter with you?
1	I hate getting upset.
1	You can't.
1	Why do you want to kill all my friends?
1	Bullshit! What do you see?
1	If this baby comes your way, look out!
1	You got to get me out of this mess!
1	What the hell is going on here?
1	I don't know what I did to piss this guy off, but he decides he's gonna kill me.
1	Are we supposed to just sit here and wait?
1	You wicked boy.
1	Say it, then, and get out!
1	Let me go! You can't do this!
1	If you ask you're going to get an absolute no.
1	They notified me.
1	Shut up.
1	They aren't moving.
1	No. - Isaac, you're not finished.
1	Sit down.
1	You can't let radarjockeys push you around. Leave it to me.
1	Bernard, I'm disappointed in you. Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help.
1	I-I know, I know.
1	You know, you're in over your head as it is.
1	What the hell does that mean?
1	You are from the warship that attacked me, are you not?
1	Pearlstein, fuck off!
1	I spend all day bleaching the smell away... Then you come home and I have to start all over again.
1	At some point, she told me about this guy who used to come around to check on her.
1	Oh, sir, you forgot your map. And our million dollars.
1	I'm your worst nightmare.
1	A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder.
1	You see, Mike, no reason to get angry.
1	Hush that yowling.
1	I'll tear it out of the calendar.
1	You don't know a damn thing about soldiering.
1	Now you're going to fuckin' die.
1	You are lucky to be chosen!
1	Anybody can type.
1	OCP cut our salaries  percent and canceled our pensions. Now they refuse to even talk to us.
1	If you won't give it to me, I'll shoot.
1	I want my passport back.
1	Now try winning a game for a change!
1	Don't you ever say that to me again.
1	Nobody's gonna make me do that!
1	Get back in ranks!
1	But get on with it!
1	He's no use to no one!
1	And now this?
1	You do it again, and you lose a limb.
1	Don't fuck with me, you know?
1	So far, I hate it.
1	He don't know the streets.
1	Then why you stand here, breaking my balls?
1	Let go, you asshole!
1	You're late.
1	Louder!
1	Do not leave fingerprints!
1	But there is a problem.
1	It upsets me that you suspect him, even for a second.
1	Hey, put the phone down!
1	We'll give him the biggest gunfight ever.
1	So do not listen to anything
1	I don't understand it and I don't like it.
1	The girl is my concern, not yours.
1	As in... pointless.
1	But hell, what a cop.
1	See? I might as well be in a Mother Hubbard.
1	I can't stand it here any longer.
1	Let us out!
1	Oh, come on. Do me the honor.
1	This is bullshit!
1	Listen to me!
1	And I can't get started.
1	None of this departmental-loyalty crap.
1	Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass!
1	I don't think so and I don't care and I don't have the time.
1	Leave it!
1	Negative, you'll have to turn back.
1	It's incredible stupidity...
1	Come on, don't just dawdle.
1	Don't be fresh, dear.
1	All those bottles, of sizes different, completely in the wrong order...
1	That's how marriages are arranged down here.
1	But it's not real.
1	What, are you guys blind or something?
1	Now get. It's all right, Bernard.
1	Look, if I'd have been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane during the war, you wouldn't have had the chance to take the pictures that won you a medal, and a good job, and fame and money.
1	Then, you know you've got a shitty witness.
1	Ladies, please, can you please quiet down?
1	You got a big nose and you're sticking it too far in my business.
1	The blood's rushing to my head.
1	Why do men think marriage is the only thing we want?
1	Let him go!
1	No she didn't. - Did you kill her?
1	Come on, Mike, turn yourself in.
1	I can see very well, thank you.
1	Bastard.
1	They changed it.
1	Get back here!
1	For chrissake, where did she come up with Louis Karasik?
1	Let's shove off!
1	Don't touch the money!
1	We're kickin' the shit outta everybody.
1	Ah! - You should listen to your brother.
1	Even if I told you what was the matter with you, you wouldn't admit it.
1	Except never take drugs and go to AA meetings for the rest of your life.
1	They climbed down the damn chimney.
1	I called him a liar.
1	Just get going.
1	Where's the bullets for this gun, man?
1	I can't get it out of my head that Junior was responsible for the camping thing.
1	Until along comes a coward with a bomb.
1	And I'm warning you.
1	It's an expression.
1	I get this he runs a good operation" shit."
1	You certainly are!
1	Let me go!
1	This is plain stubbornness and you know it.
1	You gonna call me a frequent flier, too? Who called you a frequent flier? I heard one of the nurses say that about me outside.
1	They're from the guy who pumped my stomach. Bullshit.
1	I don't want him hollering out any windows either.
1	Did you bring that guy in here?
1	You told Quinn?
1	But my shirt is wet.
1	Shame on the people who put us in here!
1	The question is what are you doing here?
1	A little restraint?
1	Inclined to hound subordinates about small details?
1	You can't arrest me here.
1	What the hell?
1	This ain't no poor farm.
1	I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes!
1	The most valuable asset against Sandstorm that we've got, and instead of turning him to our side, we're actually pushing him away.
1	On the Polhemus thing, what the fuck is happening to the fingerprints report?
1	Fight!
1	Don't call me commander.
1	I must be working out some screwed-up karma.
1	Don't talk like that.
1	Now, keep your mouth shut until you can say something suitable.
1	I got troubles of my own.
1	I refuse to answer that question.
1	I thought you were dead. I thought I was on my own. You come prancing in here with your fancy I.D.
1	Don't ask me why.
1	Go on, go to work.
1	I don't see how you have the gall to face me!
1	Nothin' man. Whatever.
1	Don't be such a noodle.
1	I'm supposed to be your partner here.
1	Bastard!
1	Let that be a lesson to ya.
1	You saw that coming, did you?
1	But I won't stand it any longer.
1	Not going to do it.
1	Feet! Feet, you fool!
1	Don't!
1	Who do you think you're punishing, huh?
1	You dress like this, you attract attention to me.
1	You cannot kill a man's family and talk about human rights.
1	You son of a bitch. You amended the charges to intent?
1	That's a shame, isn't it?
1	How the fuck did you let it get that far?
1	Now come on, you've been drinking.
1	It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit.
1	It was them that fucked up.
1	But I'm always going to be a killer.
1	I told you that swords are too dangerous!
1	Get the fuck out of this country.
1	You realize your contacting the saucer violated our instructions.
1	Kill him!
1	Stop calling me, please.
1	I don't care because he sure as hell knew after.
1	Hey, come on, Adrian.
1	Better open this door, Cooper.
1	The first time I ask you to do one thing for me, like rob a train...
1	Who are we gonna beat playing like that?
1	I'm not going back to work now, thank you very much.
1	I do not like Mr. Kirk Edwards.
1	If I thought I needed an assistant to do my job... meaning what?
1	The men aren't gonna be happy about what you've been doing.
1	I don't want you on here right now.
1	Guy ought to have his ass removed.
1	Go ahead, man to man.
1	How you going to stop me?
1	Come on, don't just dawdle.
1	So make them pay.
1	My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me about that.
1	He's selling drugs around upstairs, and he's got the rest of them locked up down here without any rights.
1	I want to go home, now. I'll talk to Nat.
1	Aren't you gonna tell me my sins are forgiven?
1	Altitude!
1	What crap!
1	The way you say that sounds so... rote.
1	I hate this place.
1	The bitch!
1	We're not going to plant anything, if that's what you're worried about.
1	I don't care if it's important or not.
1	Get out!
1	An... an accident? Easy, Joe, easy. Watch the rug.
1	I ain't a boy!
1	You ain't gonna take no car.
1	You thirsty, son? - No.
1	You and that damn book.
1	In which case, you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.
1	You are in trouble!
1	Where the hell is Special Weapons?
1	Quiet, please!
1	You took money from me when I was playing, when I was winning.
1	Go! Out of here!
1	How stupid of me!
1	Just because it is big and white and a yacht, is it not still dirt?
1	You bastard!
1	Because it didn't work.
1	But if you're asking me what I want to do, I'm telling you that I haven't decided.
1	Get up, you big hero.
1	You naughty boys.
1	You look like someone who could use a couple of hours' sleep.
1	It's out of the question, Mr. Slade.
1	You have no way of knowing the way that I think.
1	Let go of my rifle.
1	Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go, but the FSB replaced the crew.
1	Oh yeah. I had been knocked out in the pub after a shotgun to the head.
1	I don't know what I'd...
1	Did you write me that letter or not?
1	Get off of that train.
1	We were a team.
1	I'm not gonna sit here and be accused of things without any evidence!
1	The epidermal what? No!
1	Terror tactics, man.
1	Don't joke.
1	Boys...
1	Miss Anderson, listen.
1	Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag or what?
1	I command thy putrid spirit Be banished from this child's soul.
1	Today's just taking shit down.
1	What's more to the point, that money was next year's budget for the Drug Rehabilitation Clinic.
1	You're driving me crazy.
1	These young turks, hell. Their efficiency system is just a cover.
1	I'm just... so frustrated.
1	You don't think I can smell it?
1	Let him speak!
1	You wanna fire me, fire me.
1	You're ruining it!
1	That is a menace.
1	You never said a goddamn word about a tilting hydraulic body.""
1	I'll hit him!
1	Am I wrong, Lady?
1	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?
1	Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
1	No, we can't be disturbed.
1	Why don't you sit down and try not to waste my time?
1	Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
1	But a crime was committed here and I'm going after her for it.
1	What's an angel?
1	Hit the one in the middle.
1	Still you should have asked before taking it
1	Adrian, I don't think it'd be so bad if I taught him how to throw a few...
1	Mainly because I had to wrestle that son of a bitch all the way from Texas.
1	Darn it, Graham.
1	You son of a bitch!
1	Don't resist us.
1	Come on, Dale. We gotta move!
1	I hate you.

1	It's because he's relentless.
1	It's a very busy time right now.
1	Oh, shut up!

1	Don't you want to say anything to these people?
1	Get out of the way!
1	You... shut up!
1	I'll stop the car and push you out, and you'll walk the last mile home.
1	It's Euphemia.
1	Did you think we don't know about your affair with a government official?

1	Let me in!
1	MIT was after me, wanted me to rule the world for them.
1	And you also have to cross-modify your judgment that the entire universe was created just as the stage upon which the drama of the human development is unfolding.
1	I'd give every horse I own to get a chance at that fella.
1	Get between the treads!
1	You'd want your mommy too, if you had to say all this. -Cut!

1	Make it a single, Phil.
1	We've been ambushed by the very forces That you wish to trade with.
1	We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails.

1	Come on. The whole point of these takeovers is to sell off the assets and put old farts like me out to pasture.
1	I try to instil them a notion of order and method, and they always disappear for the bar!
1	I'm not trying to amuse you.
1	As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.
1	Ain't nobody in the world gonna drive this except me.
1	All I can charge him with is riding on a train. They're gonna walk.
1	All I'm saying is maybe all the child needs is to be loved.
1	And the other time.
1	I'm gonna speak to your ma!
1	Make peace, you idiot.
1	You don't know?
1	Not necessarily, this country plays tricks with the eyes.
1	This is so goddamn boring!
1	Where the fuck is he? Arnie!
1	You and that damn book.
1	I want to get something out of life.
1	But I need to know where it is.
1	You have to take off your shoes.
1	You're not even real ghosts!
1	Get off me!
1	Why are you so angry?
1	That is not true.""
1	I'm warning you...
1	I'm against it.
1	But I do, I beat their time.
1	Don't think my Pa was a pervert then.
1	All dead, you mean!
1	I hate to stand here and try your patience, but either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!
1	I mean, this is the Supreme Court.
1	All that Latino macho shit.
1	Now, you-you don't understand, Leo.
1	A little dicey doing a background on an FBI agent.
1	Because this could be a threat to all life on Earth if we are reckless with this issue.
1	This is a private conversation.
1	I must break you.
1	Go dry yourself, Keith.
1	I should have fired him when we fired Nico.
1	Aaron, why don't you just... Lighten up.
1	I will not do it.
1	You think I don't know why you got me down here on this cockamamie case?
1	Hey, quit moving in there!
1	Shit!
1	You're the kind of person that gets innocent bystanders killed.
1	I'm very upset, Charlie.
1	You made me give up my secrets when I was feeling particularly vulnerable.
1	I refuse to answer, sir.
1	Believe me, I do. I think about it every goddamn day of my fucking life.
1	Don't you recognize me?
1	You get in trouble over there, and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out.
1	Don't be an idiot.
1	All right, talk!
1	Right now!
1	Come on, Lieutenant. What are the SEALs up to?
1	Fucking cops always forget something.
1	Now, those were your exact instructions, Kirk, so don't punish Oscar for it.
1	Will you get out of here!
1	You are so infuriating.
1	Don't look at me.
1	Be gone, Satan!
1	That's too much gun for a man to have just for shooting rabbits.
1	Kiss my ass.
1	Do what he says.
1	Get outta the way.
1	I will fight against both!
1	Not good.
1	A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
1	It's a crime against the people who sent me here! We are on an official mission... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors.
1	Only to be met by this fresh and superior attitude of yours.
1	I don't know what you're talking about.
1	Stay out of it.
1	Are we gonna rescue an old man or stand here and argue?
1	We are looters, we are not murderers.
1	You're goddamn right you got the wrong room.
1	Forget it.
1	Shut up!
1	Get in the car.
1	You question the judge's integrity?
1	So the basic problem is that I'm still around?
1	We'll get him out of town.
1	I hope he dies of pneumonia. -Did you see that shit?
1	Don't Freud me, Gibbs. You're not qualified.
1	I will follow the Senator's example and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor!
1	I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.
1	Get out of the god damn hallway, George.
1	Fuck the process!
1	Well, someone needs to stay here with Adalind and Bud just in case.
1	You!
1	Better than yours.
1	All this talk's just wasting time.
1	But he kept it to himself. He kept a lot to himself.
1	Hu, our hourses' hoofs-are rigid They won't move!
1	He'll leave and take the little brat with him.
1	That'll teach you to go around saying things about people.
1	What's biting you, Adam?
1	I am very confident China is lying about an American being on board.
1	Out! Get out!
1	This time it is you who does not understand. I know Vincenzo better than you do.
1	And then I'm gonna get this right back.
1	This is our compartment, not your compartment. I would like you to leave.
1	And I hate the way you drive, and I hate your stinking whiskey breath.
1	No, I don't need time...
1	You don't park here either.
1	Now, this will get him!
1	You been busy with these dickheads.
1	Alex, will you let me finish?
1	You know, we knew you was a punk then, but you're being a punk now.
1	Ahem. Father brophy was very disturbed.
1	Stall their deliveries, push them off the streets!
1	I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home.
1	You're real dumb, huh?
1	Well, Dad, here's a hint.
1	Don't try and tell me the runway's too short.
1	Anyways, I don't give a damn.
1	What's it to you if I brought a woman, a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?
1	Can I have my store back, now that she's going?
1	Get out of the way!
1	You can Do better.
1	Well, make up a time. You know, a time like you know.
1	Gentlemen... if there are no objections, I'm the dealer.
1	Oh, he's the one who instigated this calamity!
1	He thinks he knows me.
1	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
1	Not another word!
1	Get up!
1	Never you mind.
1	Willie, don't.
1	I'm not a bimbo you can tie up and do what you want with!
1	Who dares to....
1	Quiet!
1	You must not do this thing to him.
1	Bigger than you.
1	I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story, but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government!
1	But it soon became obvious that the senor was only mildly interested in the available talent.
1	If you're guides there, I'll kill your family.
1	What do you want?
1	Everything is corrupt and incompetent.
1	You've ruined the puzzle.
1	Are you just about finished?
1	This report? - No.
1	This is not civilized!
1	So, I'm gonna call her back, and you are going to apologize.
1	They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.
1	Now knock it off!
1	Mess around with it, and it's going to kill you.
1	Damn!
1	How much longer do we have to wait?
1	Keep your head down, hotshot!
1	I'll kill you.
1	Just do it.
1	You think that's gonna fix it, huh?
1	Why the hell not?
1	Shut up and get your ass here!
1	Mind if we ask who the hell you are?
1	You will pay me back what you owe, with interest.
1	Fuck.
1	Sir Harry wants his money, fast!
1	Hey, you son of a bitch! What the--?
1	What I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you let me wear my clothes?
1	We were answering ad after ad, after ad, and we were finding that every case, every one was, in fact, someone who was prostituting themselves, someone who was being trafficked.
1	A lot of people are going to pay for this night.
1	Busted.
1	And you, all the time laughing at me.
1	No! There's no place like home.
1	I think it sucks. - What sucks.
1	I think it was a bowie knife, and I hate knives.
1	There'll be a slight delay.
1	Have you thought for a moment about anybody else but yourself, and your obsession with  letters of the alphabet arranged in a hyphenated name?
1	You ain't built for no fucking place like this!
1	Come on!
1	I'm gonna straighten you out once and for all!
1	What's it to you?
1	It can't be that difficult.
1	You come to a crime scene, you don't know who to shoot.
1	All other movements are restricted.
1	A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
1	I'll fucking kill you, man! - Hey!
1	To hell! I cast thee back to hell!
1	And I'm being asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to?
1	Kathleen, that was meant for us.
1	He ain't used to livin' like this.
1	Get out of my office.
1	Give him quinine and stop pretending you're Florence Nightingale.
1	Jack and Jill. They make the mafia look like Brownies.
1	Cut the conversation.
1	You damn fool! I told you to get off this case!
1	Yeah, you're just kidding.
1	You ever make me look stupid, you're dead.
1	Get that goddamn thing on film!
1	Give a girl a chance to breathe.
1	In that case, why don't you go to that last table... sit down, shut up, and don't move?
1	Lewis hang it up.
1	They can go to hell!
1	Well, don't bring his troubles to me.
1	What am I supposed to do, sound like a hick just to make her happy?
1	Please, one at a time.
1	I told you to fasten your seat belt.
1	Be nice to that girl.
1	Come on, man. I feel fucked up already.
1	Ah, for fuck's sake, mate.
1	All I asked you is where the hell Vera is.
1	Fuck!
1	There's a face beneath this face. - No!
1	Hey, clown!
1	Take my head to the emperor Maybe it will move him
1	There's no need for that.
1	You've got to be realistic.
1	Well, what do I care.
1	I'm the first to go.
1	I would call ... revenge.
1	A little rush?
1	You're wasting your time.
1	No, listen.
1	It's all that ghost's fault
1	They're saying they're not responsible for what people put on their website.
1	Why?
1	You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to.
1	I'm not playing at being provost marshal. And I never heard of luck that didn't run out.
1	Come on.
1	I think it's best. If I don't see you guys anymore.
1	Say what?
1	I think we have had enough... Unsupported accusations for one case... Dr. Kumagai.
1	She hates me.
1	You know this guy!
1	Come on. Stop complaining.
1	They been bothering me.
1	Stay out of sight.
1	Next time remind me to bring some aspirin.
1	Bert must be crazy.
1	You leave that door open!
1	It's pretty awful.
1	Tell her we're waiting.
1	And it's about you, and it's about Diane, and it's about the drinking, and it's about all of it.
1	She ain't got nothing on us.
1	Oh, this idiot?
1	We don't need any rush-hour Rambos there.
1	Copycat!
1	Are you kidding me?
1	Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
1	Out.
1	I said... Burn in hell!
1	Dorcas, it brings me stamps, please.
1	You're only acting.
1	Fuck your goddamn cleaner!
1	People with money like uniforms.
1	You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?
1	Got a problem with that?
1	Oh, Christ. Don't patronize me.
1	Now, that doesn't go in there.
1	The guy starts talking shit, so my brother picks one of them up. Shoots him right in the face.
1	Be quiet.
1	I think you'd better go away.
1	Bring her.
1	Hey, since when have you ever?
1	What must it be before you're satisfied with it?
1	I'm not stupid, Mr. Caulfield.
1	Did you hope to go unnoticed here?
1	Move it!
1	I'm not hearing this.
1	I might have expected your thanks for what I've done this day... but very well, let it be so.
1	I want it to be clear and known that my daughter, Jane Doe, was raped.
1	Drop that wood!
1	But don't let them take the boots.
1	Why can't this guy stay on the ground?
1	Yes, I'm talking about honour, not ideology.
1	Never!
1	I'm dead. I'm the walking dead. Are you gonna kill him or not?
1	Blue, pink, yellow or orange? - Green.
1	Now, let's get back to our examination. Shall we?
1	Who would do something like this?
1	You made the appointment without me.
1	You got me down in this goddamn water.
1	It's gonna cost him more than that.
1	You're going into the arena alone.
1	Goddamn it.
1	Don't you forget that I'm still the headman around here, too.
1	That is bullshit.
1	Some gang!
1	You better straighten your tie, Samson! Or poppa'll spank you!
1	But since you insist on being treated as one, I have no choice but to oblige you.
1	Get your little butt in here.
1	Then why do you show me no respect?
1	What?
1	Make a move, jockey, and I'll splash you across the sheets.
1	I'll ask you straight.
1	What do you want?
1	She's on her way. - Fine.
1	Do everybody. How soon?
1	You can keep 'em!
1	You will, Marlowe, you will.
1	Drop gun.
1	Now, stop distracting me. Bye, Stella.
1	You give me no choice but to ground you.
1	I hate you all.
1	I said it, damn you.
1	How do you expect to enjoy your honeymoon if you can't relax?
1	Up! Shut up!
1	Do you understand what I'm saying?
1	What was I supposed to think when you didn't come home?
1	Is he gonna be a problem?
1	That doesn't make him yours.
1	Fuckin' machine took my quarter.
1	I was told :, and it's already been an hour.
1	Where've you been?
1	I have no patience for any more shit.
1	Explain yourself.
1	You can still climb in that kiddie car and take a hike... unless you can fight better than you can drive!
1	They took the one with the collar?
1	l hate not having eyebrows.
1	Then why put up such a front?
1	Gimme a good reason why not.
1	Don't you know it's bad to light forest fires?
1	This ought to be rich.
1	You're sorry?
1	No, no parties for me.
1	No more of such talk, do you hear?
1	I'm saying you've been marking these cards.
1	They'll beg us to let them in.
1	Will you get out of here!
1	What more do you want?
1	Shut that door!
1	Don't kick me, I won't shut up.
1	Everybody calls you plain Saunders, why can't I?
1	You came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
1	Your beloved business manager, Marty Weiner the man you stayed with, the one I begged you to leave....
1	She won't, and you'll be unhappy.
1	That extension was a power of attorney, Paulie!
1	Yes, I do. - No, you can't!
1	No more questions.
1	Father, he might betray you!
1	Come over here and nobody gets hurt. OK, OK.
1	I understand why I have to be in here.
1	I'm not going down there to get a tan.
1	Aren't you ever satisfied?
1	Don't push me too far, Donatella.
1	Mark Usher's no one's friend.
1	Who you think you're messing with, you dumb animal?
1	Not now, Francois, I'm busy!
1	Where the hell are they?
1	All you have to do... is point her out and look the other way.
1	The damn insurance company won't cover you without a screen. I see.
1	I think somebody's been daubing these cards.
1	You're not getting anywhere, are you?
1	Why aren't you working?
1	Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!
1	I'm your man. Come anywhere near my old lady, I'll cut your balls off, asshole.
1	But I don't give up so easily.
1	Don't touch me.
1	I hate to stand here and try your patience, but either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!
1	All the officers were disloyal.
1	Forget it, that's enough.
1	Come off!
1	Get it and no one'll get hurt.
1	Because we've lived through it.
1	You stupid cow!
1	I should have taken the bus.
1	Don't you understand? !
1	Forget it.
1	Charlie, you had no right to do something like that.
1	I will not ever sit on those eggs!
1	You think I got this job because I fucked some fat-cat friend of Raymond's.
1	That is ridiculous.
1	There are definitely people who feel like it's your fault.
1	Silly old man looking after that young thing.
1	I'm not hiding from anybody or anything!
1	Come here!
1	Don't you say a word unless I ask you to.
1	I told him not to expect me to pull the Caine into shape overnight.
1	You get in your compartment, shut the door and lock it.
1	Don't be daft!
1	Don't bother your daddy now.
1	I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the order is final.
1	I won't tell it anymore.
1	Right. And the living room nose and the kitchen forehead and den ears.
1	Don't want any more of that.
1	I have suffered a few myself-- but we are in this together.
1	I want one hero, not two mutineers.
1	Now, you listen to me.
1	Fucking [GAY SLUR].
1	Be quiet!
1	Are you telling me not to worry but free the lab when you work everything out?
1	Six months?
1	You're starting to piss me off.
1	Do you accuse me, Mr. Stern?
1	I hate you!
1	Can he be moved!
1	It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners.
1	It will be refused, the Lady Tadminster it can open the party in the first day, and you.
1	Only when the weapons were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were.
1	Tell him it's none of his business.
1	Little punk is lying.
1	You're late, maricón.
1	I don't know why he gets so worked up over unimportant things.
1	And that's why I don't wanna talk about it if I don't have to.
1	We are not gonna pay you nothing.
1	Then there's the third murder, and we can't find any connection between this one and the first two.
1	So, don't try any funny business.
1	I'll argue with him about it later.
1	I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
1	So they took your offer as an insult.
1	It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood, in every city and state in the country.
1	I will follow the Senator's example and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor!
1	And if I refuse to sign it?
1	He's of no use to no one, including himself.
1	A guy who was a pain in the neck even before I carried his stuff.
1	Hey, Crystal, I want to show you this. Now, what's gonna happen here...
1	I'm renting a fucking bed-sit, Al.
1	I do not think you quite realise my position.
1	Don't be nostalgic.
1	Did you write me that letter or not?
1	I told you never to ask me how I feel.
1	Has anyone considered trying, Open sesame"?"
1	I do not peek.
1	Emily, why are you still using your mother's phone?
1	You did. You killed your wife. You killed benham.
1	I can't have that.
1	Hurry up!
1	Joanna! You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
1	Why would anyone recognize me?
1	No, I don't want no drink.
1	Can you tell us why you elected not to go back in and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?
1	This time, you won't get away with it.
1	And I hate these fucking doughnuts.
1	What you fail to understand... is the power of hate.
1	What does it matter?
1	Have a think, Barley.
1	Watch out, you idiot!
1	Naturally.
1	You know, you can't actually think.
1	Stall their deliveries, push them off the streets!
1	I mean the commissioner and the mayor decided not to set a precedent inviting every maniac in this city to kidnap someone.
1	They would have waited forever to go into that bank.
1	What'd you mean? Kissing that bitch?
1	I don't want any connection to this precinct. If you do it, don't do it here.
1	What the fuck?
1	Later, you fucker!
1	Help yourself.
1	After them! After them!
1	When Mr Burda's feet hurt, he drives the whole house crazy.
1	They refuse.
1	That telegram from Moscow, why should you bother about it?
1	That's something you'll never hear from me as long as you live.
1	Well, I've been trying to reach him all day.
1	If I was you, I would upload your ad onto YouTube and show them who the real genius is around here.
1	Let me say the password.
1	And w-what am I supposed to take your word for being worth?
1	Nobody move. This is a bust.
1	Convince yourself that way.
1	If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire.
1	What else could I do?
1	Let me at him, five minutes.
1	Well, you never even asked me why I was going.
1	You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother.
1	I protest against the way in which this question was put!
1	You're just some fucking pussy. Fucking pussy!
1	Designed to make your life a more annoying place to be.
1	Steve, turn me in if you want to. But this is over the line.
1	You need a good pop on the butt like I used to give your mother!
1	I'll take control away from him.
1	Come on, Mr. Delay Guardia. Really.
1	One step closer, and I'll snap her pretty neck.
1	They didn't shut me up, you did.
1	Okay, everybody out. The party's over.
1	That money was going to change my life.
1	Let me be the judge of that.
1	I'm not testifying.
1	I don't understand it and I don't like it.
1	I'm handing it to you.
1	Get off your ass, get a job and get a fucking life.
1	What are you, my mother?
1	I object.
1	I called and called. - Where were you last night?
1	Fuck.
1	I shall prove the contrary by retiring to my customary retreat, unassisted.
1	I am far more powerful than you can ever imagine.
1	Why waste it on these stupid pets?
1	I don't want it.
1	I say I cannot play a scene, and you say, Play it.""
1	What's that got to do with a train?
1	Well, that depends upon your point of view, professor. What do you mean by that?
1	You!
1	She's in the bathroom.
1	We've always embraced the very things for which others have burned you at the stake.
1	Damn it.
1	One of these days, when I get my boat built I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory.
1	Well, I'm no loser.
1	Keep your voice down.
1	You can't hold me without a warrant.
1	Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
1	Get lost!
1	If you wanna end this, let's end it now.
1	I'm not leaving this house today!
1	It's out of the question, Mr. Slade.
1	Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
1	Fuck only knows why Pat lets them in.
1	Why are all in need to run after anything.
1	Come on!
1	You've failed.
1	OK.
1	Objection overruled.
1	Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client.
1	Says who?
1	What am I supposed to do? Go to a halfway house for wayward SAG members?
1	Ringo!
1	Hey. What the hell was that?
1	How many times have I told you to keep away from my desk?
1	I think somebody's been daubing these cards.
1	Don't ruin it.
1	Let's stop wasting time.
1	You don't see what's happening.
1	I have a politician who's unable to make a decision.
1	Go home.
1	You can't buy people's souls.
1	I don't know what a Snap Dog is.
1	Leave that paintbrush here!
1	We are on an official mission... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors.
1	I thought you said that they transferred him.
1	What the hell for?
1	I don't want my picture taken.
1	Give it to me!
1	Oh I bet you do... and then  minutes later every cop in the state'd be after us.
1	Get out of here before I throw you out.
1	Move it, boy!
1	From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring.
1	Stay away from me!
1	Judge Motherfucker.
1	What the hell are you doing? -Ackerman!
1	Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?
1	My responsibility?
1	If you have something to say, say it and get out.
1	Hey, fuck you, man!
1	What the hell are you doing?
1	What's killing the children?
1	I don't want to complain, but there's an institution called dinner.
1	If I analyze military strategy, they say I'm planning a rebellion
1	Please, stop doing things.
1	Let's go give that cop a bad time.
1	You won't get away with this, Trixie.
1	It would be a start if you'd let Jeff go.
1	We'll give him the biggest gunfight ever.
1	Did you try to break into Christine Stanford's house the night of the murder.
1	Die, you bastard!
1	What am I, a pit stop?
1	Move, I tell you.
1	Don't mind Pulovski.
1	Leave your celery.
1	A lost decade, but it was worth it to make your father pay for my loss.
1	You want to hurt me? You already did.
1	Come on, come on, come on.
1	My life is none of your business.
1	You son of a bitch!
1	His foolish involvement with Lady forgotten Raikes...
1	I don't want your tomatoes!
1	She lied!
1	You know what I'm asking.
1	You get your ass over there, Gate.
1	Shut up.
1	No. And I'm sure you understand that, sister Mary of the Annunciation.
1	Besides, according to your story, you weren't exactly 100% scientist after you took it.
1	No.
1	You let me down, Mike.
1	Well, well! If it isn't our model prisoner, looking so pretty today in his little bow tie!
1	It's probably bullshit.
1	How could they with you here?
1	My argument with Villette had nothing to do with any sudden realization.
1	Tell him he's too tough for me.
1	I'll call you Maggie because that's what the Rock said.
1	Allesandro, what have you done my little sister?
1	Get off me! Get off me!
1	She wasn't even there.
1	Shoot and you'll hang for murder.
1	Go away.
1	You're staying here till the real law comes.
1	Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?
1	I don't know you get to ask that.
1	And if there was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell you, colonel.
1	I was very angry with him.
1	Keep the noise down, you stupid git!
1	We're fools to tolerate it.
1	As I told you, it's time we did something about it.
1	Ladies, stay down.
1	Stay with my mother?
1	Why should I give a crap?
1	What's this big surprise you dragged me over here for?
1	Nobody cares.
1	They refused to even participate.
1	What am I, a fuckin' stranger?
1	Not your father. Komarovsky.
1	If he refuses, you gotta insult him!
1	Of course I wouldn't.
1	Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem, needs to be taken.
1	And I ain't gonna repeat what he said.
1	You can't take a bill nobody's heard of and discuss it among 96,men.
1	What are you staring at?
1	My God, why now?
1	Acknowledge, over.
1	You gotta get these emotions under control, son.
1	Don't start that again.
1	Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry, but I...
1	You've caused enough trouble.
1	Well? Where have you been? Don't tell me you tried to call me back, because I know you did not.
1	You little spying' hyena. Did the professor put you up to this?
1	And how about translators?
1	I've told you that a dozen times.
1	I can't let that happen again.
1	If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll murder the guy.
1	Now where the hell am I?
1	Heinemann's already been up my ass so far I won't be able to sit down for a week.
1	Now, listen, don't you go around being attractive to anybody but me.
1	We're not on the same side.
1	I can't stand this spic shit.
1	Getting raped on a daily basis by upwards of  adults a day, having at these seventh grade kids any way they want.
1	Say, don't annoy me.
1	Adrian, what did I do?
1	We object to that.
1	We're the only ones who can afford to be honest.
1	Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
1	You go find it.
1	I hate you, Braden!
1	There's no bloody exits.
1	You are not going!
1	Just put me through on the phone, Sarah. Goddamn it!
1	You should have killed me when you had the chance.
1	No, forget it.
1	Let's hurry up and bury this bastard. I'm fucking knackered.
1	I'm quitting the game, Charlie.
1	Tell him it's none of his business.
1	Put him in his cabin.
1	You don't understand. - I do understand.
1	No!
1	I'm not raising my voice!
1	Let's get hold of this Johnny before the others do.
1	They transform ex-civilians into men without minds.
1	Put them down and turn your back.
1	Gimme my coat!
1	I told you I'd handle him.
1	Because it hurts my ears when you do it.
1	I'll not go!
1	If it would have helped, I'd have yelled it in the streets.
1	Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart. I don't want anyone else to either.
1	C'mon Kirk, we gotta find her before the old lech does.
1	You got a big mouth. At least you can put it to good use on the witness stand.
1	Well, I can't understand that.
1	That's enough.
1	Oh... innocence can be hell.
1	Warren, shall we continue to plan?
1	Give the old man a drink.
1	A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder.
1	I hate this whole thing.
1	And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
1	What do you hope to accomplish?
1	I'm drunker than you are, so it'll be a fair fight.
1	Let's change the subject.
1	She always ruins everything.
1	Well, that was a personal matter.
1	Just like she killed you.
1	Young lady.
1	I'm as good as Balboa ever was and I'm tired of being called a damn robot!
1	Nitrates and phosphate for ammunition... The seeds of war.
1	Mind out, cuz.
1	Give me a minute.
1	We've been through this!
1	Hurry!
1	I think you're all being unfair.
1	No. Not this time.
1	What did he tell you to tell me?
1	There is no evidence.
1	which makes twice today.
1	I'm gonna get anybody who had anything to do with it.
1	I don't see how you have the gall to face me!
1	You always blame me!
1	A map's no good in the outback!
1	And when the next plane is shot down, make sure you get the names and ages of the innocent victims right.
1	No, we can't be disturbed.
1	We'll terrorise the whole state.
1	I just did that to torment you.
1	You have been making things terribly difficult for Colonel Cathcart.
1	You've no right to think what you do about me.
1	You can't sit. Not till you pay the fare.
1	How the hell do you know where we are?
1	Don't talk like that.
1	Leave her alone.
1	Do something with yourself for pity's sakes.
1	If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't like it here.
1	I'll give her your message with my whole army.
1	Get rid of that kid!
1	Exaggerate.
1	Now you listen very carefully.
1	You get lost?
1	I'm sorry.
1	It's not so simple. What the hell isn't so simple?
1	It is out of the question.
1	Let me try.
1	She busted out in a Vegas faro game.
1	Fight for real!
1	I don't like being pushed around.
1	You cannot rent a prince.
1	One thing I don't want is to start this endless discussion all over again.
1	Then they'll say, Let's invite that Healy family over for dinner.""
1	That's all you can do. You're right. You're absolutely right.
1	Now come on!
1	We have to keep on what we've been doing and break him.
1	It seems that we are forced to admit that our suspicions are wrong, despite her confession.
1	Tony Vasquez has been shot, it belongs to us, Homicide Bureau.
1	Tell everybody to go home.
1	That decorator is harder to get an appointment with than the mayor.
1	Go to your AA meetings-- -l want to do this film.
1	Every living being is capable of attack... if sufficiently provoked.
1	Nothing.
1	Get up!
1	Don't be sneaking up on me like that.
1	You fucking lied to Garcia. -l didn't lie to him.
1	I'm trying to find some peace with this and you're not helping.
1	Sure we're friends.
1	They ain't going to expedite it for me.
1	If you soltáis ... I will kill you.
1	I mean, we're talking about one day of work. A day in which I was tied to a cactus and assaulted by snakes.
1	No way Uncle Joe is going to talk me into cutting celery again.
1	I don't want you saying nothing about the Kid and nobody else in my damn county.
1	I've been in the theatre. I'm actually a theatre director.
1	You could run a few thousand volts through him.
1	One can't expect bloody Yanks to understand.
1	Stop whining and eat your "shikseh".
1	And I stormed out.
1	They made me mad.
1	Naughty, Pumpkin!
1	He'll never see another if he doesn't learn about Rommel's artillery.
1	You should have thought of that before you left the house.
1	No, I know how to make lemonade.
1	This train can't wait.
1	Myself. When I am in possession of my faculties and Queeg is not.
1	We were deserving the money, anyway.
1	Don't be sure.
1	You're imagining things.
1	A traitor!
1	Halt negotiations immediately.
1	How you helped steal an election.
1	Did the Lord say: His Pa is a sinner and not meant to be happy?" - No."
1	Nobody can call me the things he did.
1	You've had it too easy and you don't know it. No, no. I do know it.
1	What you got on me, Kid?
1	Sucker.
1	What do you think we ought to do that's fitting and proper?
1	You're gonna leave your team?
1	I don't think we want to talk any more.
1	You little bastard.
1	Aren't you human?
1	Can't you see I'm playing pool, bruv?
1	I never want to see one in Whitehall again!
1	They'll never survive without their mother. Well.
1	If that horse would run tomorrow
1	Which hedgehog?
1	For God's sake, listen to me!
1	Pull those drapes!
1	If you want him to die, shoot now.
1	What are they fighting about?
1	And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word, but, shit.
1	No mice for you, Twister, not today!
2	Looks like you're going to have a party tonight.
2	And then one day I went into the barn... and there he was.
2	I'll get a job.
2	We got the room booked for the whole morning.
2	All right, Danny boy, what we got?
2	Carson?
2	Okay, I have to study Returns and Exchanges.
2	Come on, we don't wanna miss our bus.
2	I was just gonna come see you.
2	All right!
2	I'd like you to ride with us.
2	I think we cured you.
2	You thirsty, son? - No.
2	That's brilliant. Joey.
2	I've got to get in there.
2	God better help them and help you, too.
2	But I'll speak with you later.
2	No, I think it's a lot more exciting than that.
2	We'll go tomorrow.
2	Let's get down to particulars.
2	Can you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
2	Are you any different?
2	I will fight against both!
2	Your meal will be served presently
2	Let me just look at you.
2	But inevitably, there comes a time for waking up, even for us.
2	Are you going to be married?
2	Are you ready?
2	I'm getting off at the next stop. That's impossible.
2	Buy me a dinner tonight?
2	Why do you keep this stuff down here?
2	In front of millions. That didn't stop Mike Tyson. Luke, remember...
2	And then I'm gonna get this right back.
2	I'm just curious.
2	There's a shortcut near here.
2	Now, we better start all over.
2	I'll give you a night to remember.
2	And I'll tell you all about that job.
2	It's for my kind of money.
2	If you have something to say, shout it!
2	All right, guys, what do you got?
2	I'll ask you straight.
2	How about some more mint juice?
2	Jefe, wake up!
2	Come and fetch me, chéri...
2	It could give us time to bring our carriers within range.
2	I think you want a drink.
2	Do any good?
2	Listen to this.
2	Are you coming with me?
2	I spend time with them, yeah.
2	I'll be glad to do it.
2	I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
2	Do you know Alfredo Brunelescho, our ambassador there?
2	I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home.
2	How are you?
2	Where are they taking you?
2	Okay, everybody out. The party's over.
2	We all deserve better!
2	Yeah. I'm not really in any hurry.
2	Maybe this is God's way of reaffirming your faith.
2	So we'll go to the Ivory Tower.
2	If Nick was drugged, do you believe what he's saying?
2	If you come back, I promise I'll never do anything naughty again.
2	Why not?
2	I ran a make on that guy we've been seeing all over town. Turns out to be--
2	Best you go ask him yourself.
2	On, on!
2	How are those crackers?
2	And I said...
2	ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA.
2	We sent the messages!
2	Yeah, I really want to know.
2	Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?
2	Are we?
2	I want you to meet this young lady, okay?
2	I think it's going well.
2	We need the last word, last blow, last move.
2	How is it declared?
2	Look, I better go!
2	Good morning, Mr. President.
2	Come on, boy.
2	I'm asking you, Steve.
2	How about the Gobernador?
2	Go!
2	He said again that the more early I was going away better.
2	Mom would love that.
2	I'll be here for a couple of days and I'd love to see you.
2	What about chatting these two birds up, then?
2	Hey, I bet you'd look good in one too.
2	You've got to come out.
2	Elder, you can save us
2	Hello.
2	I think I still have the key.
2	To serve your country.
2	I know we can work through the petty stuff.
2	One for you.
2	If you're going to wonder, let's go and do it over a steak.
2	Come sit down here beside me, and I'll give you a horn of your own.
2	Daddy?
2	I promise.
2	Do you believe that the army will have more success?
2	I'd love to hear how Junior's doing and, well, it would be fun being with you.
2	Have them send me up some roast chicken and chocolate pudding.
2	I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
2	Could you have one more try? Please! See what you can do.
2	I'm gettin' me a gun, some liquor and a gold commissioner.
2	And we need to engage astronomers and amateur astronomers, and set up a sighting situation where we show them some evidence, and then show them how it's debunked.
2	Come to England.
2	What's the matter?
2	I'll see you tonight.
2	Who was that girl?
2	If that horse would run tomorrow,
2	Okay, then let's get going.
2	So, do you think you could get me a TV?
2	I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
2	What does that mean?
2	Once again, and faster.
2	Herb?
2	An Earthling to save the Childlike Empress!
2	His Excellency's waiting for you!
2	We have to leave right away. Otherwise we're gonna miss batting practice. Let's go.
2	How 'bout it, handsome?
2	Listen, I got an idea.
2	Well, we'll find out. When she's about to be convicted and I offer her a deal.
2	Then go find that guy with the arm.
2	Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch  flies a day. And that they should be collected, counted and delivered daily, by me.
2	Yeah, okay, judge Judy. ( Laughs ) What does judge Judy have to do with it?
2	Hey!
2	Linda, now you must get married.
2	All set.
2	Listen, a special envoy is coming from Moscow today.
2	What do you say?
2	That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.
2	I'm gonna take the gag out.
2	Now, are you in for $,?
2	What's up with you people and that watermelon?
2	Is there anything you want to tell us?
2	Love, charm, and violence.
2	Yeah, how you doin'?
2	I want to meet my mother.
2	I want you to see it.
2	Meet the man I'm going to marry.
2	And wait till you see the pictures.
2	I'll pay the ticket.
2	Sir, I don't care about the blame. I care about the safety of my team and I care about getting those Stingers back.
2	When I get home, I shall write a book about this place.
2	I'd like to know how she feels about who should be held responsible.
2	Are you going to look for gold?
2	I can be a friend to you, you know.
2	Are you in tonight?
2	It means I got my own lead. I saw a guy in the bar a couple of hours ago.
2	You'll hear some good music.
2	Man your battle stations!
2	I'll take my chances with the gas.
2	Did you like Captain Queeg?
2	I'm getting adopted.
2	Come on! Come on!
2	Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford.
2	I didn't expect you to.
2	And, besides, I'd like to try this case myself.
2	Let's go in.
2	I'm flying to Paris tonight, Harry.
2	Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours.
2	I will.
2	Look you're better here coping than in a clinic giving up. You're gonna be out here eventually coping anyway.
2	Including this latest brainstorm. I think you will do an amazing job.
2	I'll see you tonight.
2	Your car's ready, they called.
2	I wanted to see you.
2	I can hear the fat lady singing, Graham. I can hear her singing.
2	I'm willing to keep the conversation going, - but in the meantime...
2	Only if I deserve to be.
2	I'd appreciate your advice before we leave.
2	I have to see the Childlike Empress.
2	I want to take a look.
2	I'll save you!
2	I guess you're looking for a place right away, aren't you?
2	I do. I like her a lot.
2	We'll have dinner at the St Regis, go to a nice snappy show, then to a nightclub, sit and listen to the soft music, and who knows?
2	Give it back.
2	How about yourself? - Cool.
2	Oh, yeah?
2	OK, buddy, this is your big moment.
2	You'll be OK.
2	Is that all right with you?
2	Could I talk to you just for a second? Sure.
2	Launch sweep gear.
2	I'll get us some burritos and Cokes while you pull a few.
2	I'm going to be  next week.
2	Do you feel like having Italian tonight?
2	He wants to meet with you. Today. - Why?
2	He's waiting for you.
2	And just possibly, we will heal Some of our sickly, and/or... Crippled followers.
2	Okay, who's up for the Vatican?
2	Do we have eyes inside, Patterson?
2	What are you shits after, apart from trouble?
2	I would want no one else.
2	Can you pass some portable pumps to us?
2	Who you gonna ask next?
2	All right. Let's go.
2	Do you know anything about them?
2	What about me?
2	I won't leave you.
2	It's gonna take some getting used to, isn't it?
2	Listen, I know it's last minute... but I wanna ask you, are you free tonight?
2	Listen, a special envoy is coming from Moscow today.
2	Who's this?
2	You gonna bust everybody, or am I?
2	But I would love to hang out with you again.
2	I don't know. I must think about it.
2	Any vampires around these parts, Pa?
2	Do I take it, Mr. Delay Guardia, that the State rests?
2	Would you both like to come?
2	Come live with me And be my love
2	Yes, get me coffee.
2	Now!
2	The hostage negotiator's on his way, sir.
2	With who?
2	OK? You ready?
2	For one thing, it'd get you off the streets.
2	We'll offer the opportunity to control every aspect of their emotional lives.
2	I'm in.
2	Yeah, we're on our way there.
2	And what are you focused on now?
2	Marry her!
2	Annie, are you ready?
2	I'll bet in no time, we could have a whole new car and everything.
2	And where I come from, you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking.
2	Where did he go?
2	Wet it with tears, bleed on it, Egan.
2	And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
2	All right, but let me know what you're doing.
2	Let me talk to her again.
2	See you tomorrow.
2	I think we can finally nail Balboa.
2	Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
2	Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
2	Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.
2	If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
2	We'd roll it up and have snowball fights with it, you know?
2	Didn't he tell you that the mess boys ate the strawberries?
2	Let's get rolling, man.
2	Do not you know?
2	Oh, I've been hearing about you for a couple of years now.
2	Smell that, Rocko?
2	I wanted to surprise you.
2	I'm going to tell you a funny story.
2	Watch yourself. Kuwaiti Star, stand by. We're coming in on your port side.
2	I'm gonna force them into their room, grab their stuff, point the gun in their faces.
2	Oh, you're gonna like this one.
2	Maybe when I come back, the two of us ought to spend some time alone.
2	Anyway, we're late for school.
2	Can we have Burger King?
2	I'm not getting any younger!
2	You want fantasy, let's go to my place.
2	We're going to open!
2	Listen, I know why you've come.
2	With a little push, we can launch our amphib assault in  hours.
2	Isn't that the young woman who was staying in your house?
2	Can you get me in to see the Governor?
2	I've waited a long time for this.
2	It's portable, long-range, very expensive.
2	How come?
2	That was close, mate.
2	I'll sit by your side until you're ready.
2	I'll see you later.
2	I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change.
2	Carry on, men.
2	Come on, come on, come on, come on.
2	Joanna'll hear!
2	Let's find something to eat.
2	Tell the governor I won't wait any longer.
2	Did you see that?
2	I can try.
2	Because it's on his way. Bye girlfriend!
2	Raymond's pressing hard on that case, I imagine.
2	I'll be in touch.
2	What aren't you telling me?
2	Let's just see what's in there.
2	That's funny.
2	Let's get down to particulars.
2	What do you see in this one?

2	Why don't we see if we can find a nice place for her.
2	And I need to have a word with Gibbs, so please have a seat outside.
2	Why don't you put this on?

2	I think the city is saved.

2	I guess that's for me to know and you to find out, Detective Valentin!
2	All hands to rescue stations!
2	We have to leave! Either on a plane to Brazil, or feet first!
2	Ben, do you think people will see this video in Utah?

2	The Kid will have to play him.
2	Would that have satisfied her? What's that?
2	She ain't got nothing on us.
2	I have been waiting, for more than an hour.
2	Alright, here's how it works....
2	Why remember things when you can wish for them?
2	And you're gonna ask me questions.
2	If that's true, we were guilty.
2	A dollar's a dollar, and every dollar is taking me further West.
2	Are you okay? - I...
2	Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

2	Look what I found!
2	And when it comes time for her to marry... well, she'll be a little princess.

2	Good British plugs.
2	All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
2	Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
2	Maybe I ought to be a hero more often, huh?
2	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?
2	I reckon I'll see you later, ma'am.
2	I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now.
2	Does he come here often?

2	I like this man, I want him to know it.
2	Men, the rest of the platoon?

2	I need to see you right away.
2	I'm gonna finish it.
2	What do you think?
2	We got the right ship.
2	All I wanna do is go home.

2	There's something I'd like to ask you.
2	When did this relationship take place between Raymond and Carolyn?
2	Because they're the best. - Is there anything else?
2	You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for.
2	When he gets off the train, he'll pick up some gold and send it to me.

2	And when that bill passed, I was so proud.
2	Tell them to leave.
2	Come on up for just a few minutes.
2	Oh tots!
2	Miami needs new gigolos.
2	Did you plant the bug?
2	Can you get me some heavy downers? Something that'll really make me sleep.
2	Don't move!
2	All right, talk!
2	Did the admiral want to see me about my beard?
2	I think she's about to fall in love with him.
2	The purpose of the regatta, of course... is we're hoping to raise about $20,000,for my campaign.
2	Have you been too little?
2	Their testimony would make history.
2	Ain't gonna get tied down with no girl.
2	It's interesting.
2	Well, I'd say the New York money will probably lay about... oh, - on Lancey.
2	What do you skin?
2	Are you trying to tell me someone's dead, old boy?
2	We must be coming to the station.
2	They would have waited forever to go into that bank.
2	I'll be okay.
2	Will you take me away from here?
2	We'll find out someday.
2	It's cute, isn't it?
2	We've still got her, don't we, Hawkins? Oh, yeah.
2	So you and me are gonna make a little arrangement.
2	Could you send up champagne and strawberries? Of course.
2	No time to be shy, ladies.
2	She was a terrific girl, Stella.
2	Come on. Let's go! Let's wrap this thing up.
2	What's an angel?
2	Gonna get another one?
2	Quiet now, please, everyone pay attention.
2	There he is!
2	Well, let them see me.
2	I want to bring the same truth to this role that I brought to Guppy the newsboy in Hey, Hey, It's Guppy!
2	Let's sing!
2	And I'll have every gunboat in the Navy hunting' ole Nemo.
2	What are we working out?
2	I expect to be in the forward areas, if not actually in combat.
2	Sick dog, what's his name?
2	Follow me!
2	Gentlemen, to Admiral Rockwell Torrey.
2	All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
2	Interesting problem we got on this one:
2	I said let's go.
2	I'll show you a lot of things.
2	You'll never guess where we've just been.
2	Mayii: His stomach was acting up like a schnauzer in heat. Would they believe him?
2	Gentlemen?
2	Reel her in. Steady.
2	You want to look out at a peaceful scene?
2	I'll release them.
2	Come on! -Rexer!
2	I got plenty I can do on my own in Las Vegas!
2	How many years to come?
2	This is a good omen, what?
2	Do you feel better now that you're eating?
2	Who wants to go take a look at the city?
2	Tommy, these trunks is very special to me, you know?
2	( laughs ) I hope isaac is a deep sleeper.
2	I need to get up to see some people named Kittredge.
2	This is gonna be so great!
2	How about two foursomes of golf, huh?
2	We look forward to...
2	Yeah, and...
2	A little wine with music.
2	People, this'll be picture!
2	And if you want something sugar-coated, I'll order you dessert.
2	Could I get a level from you, please?
2	Wait!
2	And Miss Harvey's waiting.
2	You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
2	You want some hot coffee, huh?
2	Because I want to help people, sir.
2	And what I want is for you to befriend him.
2	If you start to hesitate, call me.
2	Let's go and see my cousin.
2	I wanna see him...
2	I just want to learn my lessons and do my studies. So I can be smart and become a priest!
2	Well, I hope you've managed to get the money, Mr. Lester.
2	Are you able to offer something?
2	Come over here and nobody gets hurt. OK, OK.
2	Sweetheart, what are you doing home?
2	And we are going to get drunk, Cross.
2	This year, it's gonna be different.
2	It is not usually he writes to me.
2	Hi, nice to meet you.
2	A hundred years from now, nobody will know the difference.
2	Señor Marlowe, I want to show you our town.
2	A young boy needs our help.
2	Let's see!
2	How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter?
2	I'm going for wine.
2	I'll risk it.
2	Come on, you too!
2	If I use my last wish...
2	I'm dead but I'm still functioning.
2	Hell, I got a whole yard full of stuff you can start in on next.
2	You throw double sixes again, and I'll have you burned for a witch.
2	God, I've gotta be with her, at least till she learns my name.
2	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle, what is it?
2	Maybe they can take us.
2	How's school?
2	Hey, would you get a load of this joint?
2	If I get this shot, you'll like it a lot better, right?
2	Ladies and gentlemen, the famous Jo Conway has gladly consented to sing a few songs for us tonight.
2	You all right?
2	Okay, I'll just get my check and I'll be in Saginaw before nightfall.
2	Must have been  degrees to the shadow! There was no a cloud in the sky.
2	Just a walk in the park.
2	Maybe a house in Mazatlán where they are rich.
2	Just give me the stamp. I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your name is.
2	I want a room, a big room.
2	Come and fetch me, chéri...
2	I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
2	Why have you no hangover?
2	I'll see you later, Shooter.
2	Now, there was a possible sighting two days ago in the Dalles.
2	It is the first truly I did what I wanted.
2	Keep in touch.
2	It could be.
2	We could be rich, if you say the word.
2	We know exactly what that man has the potential to be.
2	I'm going to put a lot of money in here.
2	It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing.
2	I want to sit in front.
2	Evie talked with the Inglethorp and it goes away.
2	This time, you won't get away with it.
2	She figured out where the kids are being held, and she wants us to go rescue them.
2	I'll take the scenic route by foot.
2	Let me have a taste of it.
2	When neither of them made the cut,
2	Bastian, I'm waiting!
2	I'll tell you how I first met your mother.
2	I'm gonna get the girls.
2	Come on, Linda.
2	Better have something to give me this time, officer.
2	Somethin' wrong with your car?
2	Look what's in the street.
2	The X-rays will be along shortly.
2	Hey, man, tell me what's up, maybe I can help you.
2	We should be there in about  minutes.
2	We want it now.
2	Our own Mayor Kuzak.
2	He'll be a good friend.
2	Here, you have a go.
2	I got shoes. Wanna see?
2	I'm expecting a baby.
2	Have you found your perfect woman yet?
2	I'll see you later.
2	In the last two years of his life, he gave away most of his fortune... in large, anonymous donations, to your charity.
2	It's gonna be a treacherous hike.
2	Is that all?
2	They're coming to get you, Barbara.,
2	Kirk was producing a motion picture, his first.
2	Now!
2	Stay focused, keep your distance. You must not be revealed.
2	When do I get the money?
2	You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.
2	They say you offering me favours.
2	If I ask you to kill someone?
2	Okay, we need to locate Oliver's father immediately.
2	So, do you need me to try to remember something?
2	I may have use for such misplaced devotion.
2	I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
2	How is she?
2	I've got something down here.
2	Is this the greatest day in your career?
2	I want to play the pain in Peter.
2	Tomorrow?
2	I'll be out in a minute.
2	I would put money on us.
2	I'll see you later.
2	I'm anxious to get back to the office.
2	Do you know what that means?
2	Let all that breathe partake
2	Let's go!
2	I'm gonna do it now, Willie.
2	If I hadn't seen you on the news, I wouldn't have known who his partner was.
2	Then come the physical proofs:
2	Remember the Herefords in Yatrona County?
2	This ought to be rich.
2	Guys, look!
2	Preparing to move. Three passengers. On schedule.
2	Then they'll meet with you.
2	All the Nuke you'll ever need.
2	The job isn't mine yet, Leslie.
2	I want to hear everything you've been doing.
2	Do you think my wife is beautiful?
2	It's time I faced up to what I do have to do.
2	Let me talk to her. Let me just talk to her.
2	There he comes!
2	Easy. What is it?
2	We're trying to get to a place called Soda City, a couple of hundred miles north, I think.
2	What's your bike? I drive.
2	Well see you!
2	I'll tell you later.
2	Unfortunately, Murder Incorporated beats a path to their door first.
2	got a strong back. And a strong desire to escape.
2	We're going on a big ship across the ocean and take you home.
2	Something wrong?
2	I'd like to meet him, Rock.
2	Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.
2	Kate's going in there and lend a little comfort to the prisoners.
2	You'll have a lot more fun with Julia.
2	It's just that we have our annual audit coming up and I thought I should probably stay put.
2	Mark: Once upon a time, there was a little boy named isaac
2	I can't wait.
2	Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
2	I said, shall we start...
2	Attention on deck.

2	Please call me when you get settled.
2	The show goes on in five minutes!

2	First we'll get you legal and tuck you in bed with Angela.
2	Why don't we go and celebrate at some nice, quiet little restaurant?
2	Round up everybody on a motorcycle.
2	That'd be an invitation to enemy subs.
2	Dovitch, I can't wait to tell you about my feature for the next issue.
2	It's her, isn't it?
2	I'm gonna bust your butts... to make this the best damned outfit in the European command.

2	What do you want it to be?
2	I suggest that we do.
2	Sergeant Taggart is here, he wants to talk to you.

2	In , I formed the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence, to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations.
2	Cease fire!
2	But...
2	I've got you the assignment of your dreams!
2	I've got a plan.
2	You're gonna drink it all, Seth Dove, even if it takes all night!
2	He might be able to make up some kind of a case, but it would cost money.
2	I'm going to the zoo.
2	Showtime.
2	I'm going to put a lot of money in here.
2	Everybody's a screwball in some way.
2	Michael Paul needs me.
2	Can we have coffee?
2	Oh, yes!
2	I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it.
2	Hey, babe, you playin' cards?
2	It's dangerous, but it just might work.
2	I want you to get me a quart of beer, Miller High Life.
2	It's a big nut to crack.
2	It's simple and I'm helping, so we knock it off in three or four days.
2	Our supply convoy, already at sea, will arrive here tomorrow night.
2	Here we are!
2	Johnny, get a load of this.
2	What about the Berserkers?
2	He'll be safe with me.
2	I'm trusting you to be discreet.
2	That's-that's very kind of you. I hope that you and your wife were-were not uncomfortable.

2	Let's just win the game.
2	The case against him it will be filed comme ça!
2	Ready to ride? Let's roll. If I'm gonna get inside this gang and stay out of jail,

2	And after dinner we could go...
2	Of what it is of use?
2	He wanted me,
2	Have you got anybody with you?

2	I'll go with you.
2	I want coconut.
2	All right, let's go shopping.
2	I'll see to it.
2	Let's stay just a little longer.
2	What are you doing here?
2	What news have you from the factory, dear?
2	I fancy something a bit sporty. - That one.
2	Pain-in-the-balls Marcus needs to go see the chest doctor.
2	Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
2	Shortly after midnight as a surprise.
2	Because I watched Jane go through exactly what you're going through right now.
2	Yes, I would.
2	Let's go!
2	I'm going to see if I can talk to that young girl.
2	I'm about to go get a slice right now.
2	That is very interesting, mon ami.
2	Princess Vivian! Come down!
2	New places, new people and new sites of interest.
2	Great view. I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.
2	There's no harm in hearing the young lady out, is there?
2	Be well, Ronnie.
2	It's my birthday. I thought I'd invite you for dinner.
2	I want to show you something.
2	It's loaded.
2	Maybe I should just go back to the clinic?
2	The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
2	I'm on my way back to Rayburn.
2	Maybe it'll take a few months, maybe a year.
2	I killed her! I killed her like she was an animal.
2	There is an enormous confusion.
2	Because I want to.
2	Get ready to grab the son of a gun.
2	Johnny, let's go spring Chino.
2	Take me home.
2	Then you have to talk to him before tomorrow night.
2	Looking forward to it, I might say.
2	I have information for you.
2	Better?
2	I think it's a setup. This man...
2	I'll go with them!
2	So, one day, it was my turn and I was just so determined that I was... gonna show her I could be just as good as she could.
2	I'm going to see my mother before she dies... in Russia.
2	The blood of Baphomet knows all truth.
2	By Tuesday, everyone in the state will know you.
2	Learn to read, walk, talk, smile, and even fight.
2	Michelle, a drink here for my friend.

2	Fantasia!
2	Ready for testing.
2	Sister Liz, I've got to give the girls their Religious Studies class in fifteen minutes.
2	Who would do something like this?
2	If the check hasn't cleared, we can still get out of it.
2	Go get him, Dad!
2	I was wondering if you'd care to join my wife and my sister and me in a game of bridge?
2	The show is about to commence.
2	Let's get her!
2	And now, he wants to buy me?
2	You wanna get something to eat?
2	We've made our decision.
2	Put this on.
2	Now you can show Papa some of them tricks.
2	We're ready and waiting.
2	Professor, professor!
2	We certainly are, senorita, because we understand you got a lot of talent.
2	Who's there?
2	Hey, daddy's friends are here.
2	Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out?
2	So, we expecting company?
2	When will you come back to me?
2	We ain't hungry... not food hungry anyway.
2	This job isn't going to be like any of the others, Hank.
2	Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.
2	Shall we, eh, have a look at  again?
2	Just apply a pint to your body and you're good for hours.
2	I'm having friends in on Wednesday for dinner and drinks.
2	Better let me do the talking.
2	You're on! - Let's go!
2	The sooner you get that, the better off we're all gonna be.
2	You'll be impressed
2	Why is he so against your testifying?
2	Now they got  of that Englishman's goons, and more are coming!
2	I also think we'll know very soon who it is.
2	Why?
2	When the world is ready... for a new and better life... All this will someday come to pass...
2	Think that lady in the red dress'll go home with me?
2	Of course. That's it.
2	Okay, then let's get going.
2	Juliette does not get on that helicopter with the Royals. Instead she goes over to Nick's house and tries to kill him?
2	What flight and what name? The name is...
2	I decided to change all: our life, our home. I'll start here in Turin, in your so cold and dreary palace, ... With new furniture and paintings,
2	When the team works, everybody wins.
2	Could be.
2	Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
2	So I'm trying to help her.
2	So, you guys are mounties?
2	Do you wanna make love?
2	I asked him especially, and he told me to tell you.
2	That means she can probably handle the kidnappers on her end.
2	We know where you live.
2	And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
2	What do you want?
2	Yeah, Col. Brant.
2	Not too bad.
2	What about a little music?
2	Please, Johnny.
2	Would you like some coffee?
2	Why don't you have another one?
2	Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.
2	You got yourself a job.
2	The cops didn't give you trouble, did they?
2	You're not afraid, huh?
2	Thanks, Kid.
2	I want to find out about this place.
2	No, I just want some answers.
2	To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.
2	Yeah, I think so.
2	This is how you do it...
2	The whole buck?
2	We'll have Tobruk in a few days.
2	Here's another mystery for you to solve:
2	Getting there by : would be terrific.
2	Have you got any interest in coming home to New York?
2	Can I have a Scotch and soda?
2	Soon, sir.
2	Wonderful! What's it say, honey?
2	I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
2	We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past.
2	May I help you? Miss Vale.
2	We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last  years, more than  planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support
2	We flew from Rome in your private plane, remember?
2	Send me to Paris.
2	You're not gonna give us any trouble about it.
2	We're due for five days of sunshine.
2	We'll take them like the last time.
2	Go ahead.
2	I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys.
2	The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
2	Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.
2	We got a thousand man-hours on this. Nobody's walking away.
2	So maybe death isn't the end, Doc.
2	What's happened now?
2	Please keep in Leslie?
2	Sweetheart, look what just came in the mail for you.
2	Father.
2	You've been served.

2	It'll be history.
2	Let him go!
2	There sure is gonna be some interesting people at that party.

2	Remember those commercials you did?
2	This report? - No.
2	Pretend the guy's like a balloon.""
2	Then we'll have brunch by my private lake.
2	We await...
2	The judges that are making these decisions are gonna be read about in history.
2	I want to help out people that I like.
2	It's time to make a move.
2	Can I have a bite?
2	Wait till you hear what's going down. It's strange.

2	Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
2	Where's the woman? She's on the train.
2	I want to see it.
2	I took the liberty of ordering everything. I didn't know what you'd like.
2	We did it, Mr. Cassidy.
2	Rocky, up!
2	Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement. - - Would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him?
2	Everybody that comes to Hollywood got a dream.
2	Yes. Take care now.
2	Your famous Ringo is safe.
2	Sweetheart, who was that on the phone?
2	Well then let's have fun, baby.
2	I have defeated you?
2	What do you say, cousin?
2	What's up, boss?
2	Why didn't you tell me about you and Carolyn?
2	Where are you, Dante?
2	Unless he had a plan.
2	Hey, can I help you?
2	You get to be the mayor who cleaned up Detroit.
2	This test may tell us why.
2	Mr. Koreander?
2	Why don't we all go to town?
2	Yeah, yeah, yeah...
2	We're going to build a brand-new city where Detroit now stands.
2	He's gonna do it. Come on!

2	I'm gonna be good, you wait.
2	I appreciate this damn thing more and more every day.
2	Everybody ready?
2	Started spending every night together.
2	No, but the mere thought makes my mouth water.
2	When the Vice-president calls you, I'll meet you in the centre aisle.
2	Well, why you not make her dance more?
2	It means we can get back before Erica gets home.
2	We're due back in Berlin as early this evening as we can make it.
2	I'm through making mistakes.
2	Haven't you heard?
2	Good work, Carol.
2	Couldn't we have something brought in on trays like big executives?
2	They gonna be full up, from what I hear.
2	Night!

2	What does it say?
2	Let's get on with this.
2	Okay.
2	Dr. Chandra, I am waiting for your reply.
2	Hello. You must be Vivian.

2	Things started to pick up for the home team when Maria's brother, a ganef if ever I saw one, took the stand.
2	We're opening a store and a bank, aren't we, John?
2	We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.
2	Shall we play ball, boys?

2	No! We're extracting! Give me the breaching charges!

2	I feel another song coming on.
2	Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?
2	Nothing to worry about.
2	I'm very excited, Simon.

2	You sure?
2	We can't wait for it.
2	There's gonna be a lot of money in town.
2	It's me, Vinnie.
2	Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway.
2	Or haven't you heard?
2	Set compressors and prime!
2	Set us free!
2	Lieutenant, what exactly happened here?
2	Does that make you more comfortable? - Man:
2	Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like to read you a poem to welcome you back.
2	Am I wrong, Lady?
2	Think you can pick one of them out of there and be your pet?
2	Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow.
2	we can work something out. - That's a sweet offer, but not now.
2	Future history, he said.
2	Well, I'll fly down to Memphis in the morning and feel them out.
2	So if you can just enjoy yourself with him like he's enjoying himself with you....
2	Request permission to leave. - Captain, sir?
2	We've got to leave.
2	We can still make it.
2	We're nearing Vulcania.
2	Everybody's waiting.
2	What can he do?
2	Come with me.
2	I can grow another one in a week.
2	You're young, you'll figure it out.
2	Push! Here it is! Here it is!
2	I do not know who plays the violin. Paganini.
2	I got some news.
2	Hey, Williams!
2	He needs someone to underwrite the paper. Find out who.
2	Shall I tell you the rest of the story?
2	We're gonna get married.
2	We'll have a whole factory.
2	I want you to handle this case personally.
2	I'll be out in a minute. - There's no hurry.
2	I know the answer.
2	I'm really gonna enjoy this. - Give it a rest, will you?
2	We'll be in touch.
2	Now, look, I'm an American film director, and I was talking to your sister tonight about going to America to play in the movies.
2	Puts the bag in the basement freezer... And waits.
2	By the way, any messages for me?
2	Dad? Dad...?
2	We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past.
2	It ties up with their maximum effort to defend that island.
2	Of course.
2	I'm an actor, see?
2	Not like a scientist, like an... artist.
2	Now that's... not a great deal of effort for more money than you ever dreamed of. And no risk... no risk to you at all.
2	Tonight's the night.
2	So some of the guys've been wondering if you are who you say you are.
2	What do you think is right?
2	Can I help you with that?
2	We must expose and punish it...
2	What makes you think we're living in this day and age?
2	Very well. I'll introduce them to you.
2	You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
2	Okay, okay, I think someone had a long day And could use a good night's sleep, right?
2	There's gonna be a lot of money in town.
2	He wants it all hush-hush.
2	Have you known Suzanne long?
2	Quinn goes on wherever he's going.
2	All right, mister, you know the routine.
2	I'm taking a bath.
2	Shortly after midnight as a surprise.
2	It will be a fine thing to do.
2	Yes, I'd like to say it 1,000,times.
2	How much longer is this Dickson going to hold out?
2	I'm in.
2	The Kid will have to play him.
2	Come on up for just a few minutes.
2	Get anything yet?
2	Let's go!
2	It provides us that delicious house over there.
2	That looks really good.
2	Prisoner has a right to escape, hasn't he?
2	Oh, Melba would be mighty proud of you if you won yourself $25,000.
2	Who was killed?
2	Yes.
2	Find out anything?
2	Someday the revolution will come and we can overthrow our leader.
2	He'll have to be committed....
2	You've come to the right place, buddy boy.
2	They'll be instructed, Captain.
2	Then I'm going to write him a letter right now and cheer him up.
2	The celebrated list.
2	We got a new man coming in.
2	How'd we do?
2	This way, Keith.
2	That Englishman wants a fight?
2	What is that?
2	Yes?
2	How long is your program?
2	I'll see you tomorrow.
2	Tell what?
2	He might even put in bleachers. Oh, yeah!
2	It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners.
2	I'll get chocolate chip. Coming up.
2	Well, can you give me what he has?
2	And every day since you started. The usual?
2	Brother Jeeter, will you join me in a song?
2	Come on!
2	We got this thing won already!
2	How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter?
2	Yes, ma'am?
2	I was winning'.
2	Did somebody say chase"?"
2	Come down. - It's making you nervous?
2	You also said you had money.
2	Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore.
2	Come to Papa.
2	Very handsome.
2	If you think about getting cute I'll blow that shit you call brains all over my partner here.
2	You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married... when he comes back from the maneuvers.
2	I was wondering if by any chance you guys were hiring.
2	You'll beat me but you'll go down, Mike.
2	I think he wants to die.
2	There it is.
2	You ready for some eggs and grits?
2	Can you tell us why you elected not to go back in and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?
2	Come off!
2	I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate.
2	I'm gonna put a stop to this.
2	I'm going to smoke when I go outside.
2	Who's the dame?
2	You gave me your word.
2	I've been thinkin' about gettin' on the highway patrol.
2	You said it's never been done in the history of the DA's office.
2	Hey, did you collect from the Ryans yet?
2	In here! Quickly!
2	I'm meeting somebody.
2	I could do with a lot of that.
2	Can I count on you?
2	We'd love to.
2	Do you girls mind if we run some timing trials?
2	Now, we must act immediately.
2	You really are afraid of this place.
2	I've got it...
2	You know me?
2	If you insist, I'll have eight more.
2	How about that drink?
2	We are presenting a performance.
2	I'll be back tonight.
2	Jerry: And where does the boner come into this story?
2	You can do it, buddy.
2	You gonna play the Kid?
2	Come and meet the others.
2	Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.
2	When it's gone we're done feeding'. - Pass the chicken.
2	Are you saying he's dead? Not lying down dead, my friend.
2	I'm going to hit you now Ready or not, here it comes!
2	I'll see you later, Shooter.
2	Looks like the coast is clear.
2	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
2	Are you drinking my coolers?
2	I can't wait.
2	I'd love to go with you, Mr. Murdock.
2	Busy tonight?
2	But and the Duchess?
2	I'll talk to you later.
2	Let me have those things.
2	I'm just a little anxious to get up there and whoop ET's ass, that's all.
2	You are lucky to be chosen!
2	We all have ideas of right and wrong. - - But we have to pitch in for the good of the family.
2	She's very attractive, I know.
2	Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
2	I'm looking for a girl.
2	We got an unknown in here.
2	If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you.
2	Imagine this place on that day when the battleship Aurora" fired that blank shot which signalled the Revolution."
2	Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
2	I'm gonna kill it.
2	Why Rivoli?
2	Better jump into the tree and hide
2	What you fail to understand... is the power of hate.
2	We were just going to dance.
2	I'm going to take this directly to Johnson.
2	You better come back.
2	Come on, bring it up.
2	Come on over to my place.
2	Hey, I'm a mama.
2	I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before.
2	I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie.
2	Can I have my store back, now that she's going?
2	Now, Warren, what time do we meet tonight, huh?
2	If you're going to wonder, let's go and do it over a steak.
2	I'll see you later.
2	Enter, my spy.
2	But I'll speak with you later.
2	C'mon! Hurry!
2	You heard about this guy, Al?
2	You deserve this, Duffy.
2	Come here for a second, please.
2	We could be rich, if you say the word.
2	But she can't say that, which means all Donna stole was a meaningless stack of papers.
2	Do you know any Spanish?
2	By the way, here's something that'll interest you.
2	I'd like to introduce you to...
2	I hope you'll enjoy this.
2	Bon voyage, Barley.
2	Here, rally round and I'll show you the points of interest.
2	But it's happening!
2	Cool it! Or you're gonna get the same thing your boyfriend got.
2	You said you could supply weapons?
2	Now that I've shot my face off, I'll give you the chance to do the same.
2	You see kiddo, you can barely taste the alcohol. Go ahead and finish it.
2	I get this he runs a good operation" shit."
2	How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
2	You don't know?
2	I'm gonna get me one of these.
2	Come here, little boy.
2	How about a cup of coffee?
2	Listen, I gotta go to work now.
2	You see that man giving screwface to Jake?
2	Well, we're off to do some shopping, honey.
2	I'm having a ball.
2	Hey!
2	Hey, I'm looking to party, can you help me out?
2	You wanted to see me?
2	Come on, make a wish.
2	We want it now.
2	So he goes out and he buys a bunch of roses.
2	That's true.
2	You just move!
2	Come here, quick!
2	Give me a call when you get this.
2	I'll come by, like, :?
2	I have something I'd like to show you.
2	Hey, chief.
2	But we will be still more intelligent.
2	Come here!
2	But you make one slip, just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage.
2	Lovely lads and so natural.
2	I am far more powerful than you can ever imagine.
2	My blood group is very unusual. Look!
2	Why, that's exactly what I was about to do, sugar.
2	I'll play.
2	Where's a good place?
2	Call me as soon as you find it out.
2	Make your wish.
2	Sir, I want to see what whaling is like.
2	Well, what are we waiting for?
2	Come on, the tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.
2	We're payin' 'em back, boy.
2	Have a cigar, Kirby, and I'll join you.
2	You may be right.
2	You were winning?
2	I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.
2	Hey, I bet you'd look good in one too.
2	All we want to do is talk to you.
2	Yes, I'm looking for a place in town.
2	When I wake up I tell them what I dreamt.
2	You're fucking right.
2	But when I go I go with a bang.
2	And, Daisy, we have a breathtaking adventure in front of us.
2	Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
2	You want a beer?
2	Yeah. What did you ask up, buddy?
2	I can make a recess happen.
2	But that's what's so marvelous.
2	You tell Adalind?
2	Only in America do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event.
2	I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you.
2	You could make a handsome profit on your stock.
2	Never!
2	Listen, I-I know you're gonna think this is real dumb of me, but, uh, I haven't been feeling very good lately, and, uh...
2	Did you light the hearth in my room?
2	I should still have enough clout to pull that off. What do you say?
2	I must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
2	Old Yellowstain will be flattered.
2	I hadn't spoken to him in  and a half years.
2	If the city can pay, we'll be humiliated.
2	I'd like to speak to...
2	You know what we're fighting out there, and they know it!
2	We'll have just one drink and then we'll go.
2	How am I gonna get to first base with this girl?
2	Oh, yes, I do. I want you to go home and tune in the show!
2	There's no way you could make them talk. You're dealing with extremists.
2	OK, fellas, this is it.
2	I think a little mood lighting is appropriate.
2	You have talent, I made the best use of it.
2	Cheers!
2	See you around.
2	I'm here to admit you and, God willing, help you.
2	He was quite suspicious at first, but you were right. When I told him you killing Nelly Benin was a fake, he bought it-- as you say-- hook, line and sinker.
2	He's waiting for you.
2	Bob speaking.
2	We got a schedule. Come on.
2	call me tonight or I'II go crazy.
2	You see the moon out there?
2	Why are you dressed like that?
2	You have to take off your shoes.
2	I still have the witness to look after
2	But that's what you got to do.
2	Now, my news.
2	Come in.
2	I don't know.
2	You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.
2	I'm gonna take you to all the capitals of all the countries in the world.
2	But a crime was committed here and I'm going after her for it.
2	Yes, I come back, baby.
2	Give him $.
2	I've always wanted to go to Paris.
2	OK. Are you ready?
2	Is it important?
2	We were just going to dance.
2	I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
2	Did anyone else?
2	I'm going to take you and buy you a drink.
2	No, the scotch will be fine.
2	I suggest you keep that promise.
2	We need to intercept them before they pay that ransom.
2	And you and I are going out together.
2	We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute.
2	Why don't you go play the piano?
2	Five, four, three, two, one. Go! Go!
2	You see, I was thinking of writing my story, so I bought this book on how to do it.
2	Now it's show time.
2	Get me some punch.
2	In the interest of the West's greatest horse, the bronco and myself, who grows them, I'm putting up an extra $1,000,to the bronco rider who wins!
2	In a few months, I will become a citizen.
2	So, how hot are my girlfriend's new jeans?
2	I know what you're thinking.
2	I just showed courage. - How many fingers you got left?
2	We'll answer anything you want to know.
2	But I promise you that it will be the biggest innovation in the history of this business.
2	Come on, then!
2	I think it was a bowie knife, and I hate knives.
2	I'll do one for you. How about that?
2	I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.
2	I wonder what's on the television?
2	I'm going to testify about Rusty's conduct of the Polhemus investigation.
2	I'm gonna get a closer look at it.
2	I'm still in my office, I'll wait for you.
2	I'm going up to Dolphin's house.
2	I look forward to it, sir.
2	I'm gonna use it.
2	Get in touch with them. Meet us at the border.
2	I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
2	I'll see you tomorrow.
2	Can we track the grandmother's cell?
2	I can pull it out and let you take a whip_ if you'd like.
2	I was wondering when you'd show up.
2	I'm not resigning my senior partnership the day after what happened, happened, if that's what you're asking.
2	Listen, I'll pay his fare. - Fine.
2	As our tools for exploring this vast expanse continue to improve, the answer to our question comes more clearly into focus.
2	You guys, I'm so excited!
2	And one other thing:
2	And then you get free.
2	You have exact change?
2	Correct?
2	I can do it.
2	Listen, I'm trying to make a living here.
2	I want you to know something, Scott.
2	I'm going with you.
2	I'll be right back.
2	I'm expecting great things from you.
2	I'm staying.
2	Hey, you gotta come in and see this one.
2	If you and Joe'll gab on about this appointment, I'll see the committees.
2	What'll it be?
2	But my problem is, there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police.
2	Announcer: Here's Ernest and Fanny rae weller.
2	Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
2	All right, what's happenin' out there?
2	I'm glad you're making new friends.
2	I can't make it tonight.
2	All other movements are restricted.
2	I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change.
2	Came here to play.
2	Got it!
2	Did Mr. Tarlow call anybody in the room by name?
2	Bloomy, were you asleep?
2	You fall for a fruit man, you run off and marry him. Boy June, you really know how to pick them.
2	Yeah, yeah, that's a really good idea, because if anybody does come here, it's just me and Adalind, and, you know, the little guy.
2	He knew of everything for Dorcas.
2	I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
2	I shall wish a book jacket that is only letters.
2	Do any good?
2	I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
2	What do you think they're all talking about,
2	I start to realize I got a chance to make amends.
2	What if we use the first letter of every word?
2	Lucy's turning six this week but I don't think we'll have a clown this year.
2	You know, I think I'll go back East and work for a while.
2	I have lots of things to attend to today, Leon.
2	I'll see you inside the party.
2	I've got to appoint a new senator.
2	We'll discuss it later, whenever you're ready.
2	Shoot, Lieutenant.
2	Hey, Angelface.
2	Want to trick me?
2	Now why don't you drop that tree you're holding and let's grab a vine and swing a little, huh?
2	Open the door!
2	Considering who's in the compound, my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded.
2	I'll play.
2	I'm taking a bath.
2	You mind if I take my boots off?
2	l should think you would.
2	I wanna go home.
2	Why don't you come in and join...
2	Today!
2	That's right! Fantastic!
2	You need sort of a...
2	Brian?
2	Going to have dessert when we finish our hot dog?
2	And He was sent to save us.
2	I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
2	And I'm willing to pay for what I want.
2	Come on, Nasser!
2	Next girl. Show what you can do, Waruschka.
2	Clear everybody out!
2	Oh, I'd love to live out in the country.
2	You know what they say about black cops in the ghetto?
2	What are you trying to do to me?
2	We'll have dinner at the St Regis, go to a nice snappy show, then to a nightclub, sit and listen to the soft music, and who knows?
2	Seek out and engage the enemy."
2	Maybe I'll run into you.
2	I say, something kind of important has come up.
2	I'm ready.
2	May we hear our next bid, please?
2	I'm supposed to have some interesting dreams.
2	Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
2	You know why I didn't hire you back then?
2	When are you going?
2	We're here to kick some major league butt.
2	You must be wondering why I called you here.
2	Oh, wait.
2	Do you know the meaning of love, professor?
2	Harry. Remember how you used to say life wrote lousy scripts?
2	I got a better idea.
2	You made an oath to obey the law.
2	Kiss me.
2	It is time to fight.
2	I wanna see what he's all about.
2	I want to speak...
2	Now, they're probably gonna crown us King and Queen of the Costume Ball.
2	Let me see.
2	I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
2	Darling, your present just arrived.
2	I, on the other hand, had beaten them at their own system and subsequently Rose rather effortlessly, floating up from mere marketing through the corridors of policy and on to the board and along the way promoting Stella
2	Well, why not liven them up... with the snack food that's sweeping America.
2	I did not escape from there alone.
2	Coming!
2	I need something something that can fly and that can scare the pants off anything living in that castle.
2	You boys hungry?
2	I'll get a job until I get a grubstake, and then I'll try again somewhere.
2	I know you want to get out of here, and so do I. We're going to do it.
2	If you and Joe'll gab on about this appointment, I'll see the committees.
2	You could make a handsome profit on your stock.
2	Dickson, I'd like to talk with you about the bank.
2	What's the latest?
2	Come on, let's move.
2	Anything interesting?
2	I'd like to ask a few questions.
2	What is your work?
2	Now, this is as good a time as any, Harry, to get our relationship straight once and for all.
2	But I don't know anything about Martinique.
2	If we push this, who are we pushing against?
2	Can't we walk and get friendly, or better acquainted, or something?
2	But then, I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you.
2	I'll get Macallan back.
2	Yes, should to kill.
2	Hey, Paul, you going to the convention tomorrow?
2	Oh, the storm's coming.
2	Isn't this exciting?
2	Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon?
2	Hold on, there.
2	You and I could go there.
2	Here we go!
2	Early days yet, sir.
2	Now is as good a time as any to learn.
2	Very interesting. They give a good dental plan to you?
2	I was wondering if your guy could treat my pool.
2	If you worked for the imperial court your future would be boundless
2	How are things?
2	You know our man fucked up a couple feds on the out?
2	No diaphragm in that lady. What happened to it?
2	No, I've got to see you.
2	There never has been a Marie Clément at your hospital.
2	You reckon this'll make the colonel happy?
2	But the team comes first.
2	Howard, how are you?
2	I will protect you.
2	I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment. For both of you.
2	And hear, actually. The language is something you're never gonna forget.
2	Yeah, I'm just waiting for the taxi.
2	They tell me you're quite a stud player, young man.
2	Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.
2	But it'll look great on you.
2	Are you ready?
2	You get a line, I'll get a pole We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole
2	I've been very patient, Johnson.
2	You see, Mike, no reason to get angry.
2	By Molto. No discussion. Interview.
2	Hey, did you find him?
2	I'm moving abroad.
2	But there's tomorrow.
2	I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office, but it needs a little ceremony.
2	Can I get you a drink?
2	There'll be other dinners, Phil.
2	You can be famous.
2	Some soda. Can I have a soda?
2	Give me the money.
2	Now, who's next?
2	You remember this guy.
2	But that's what's so marvelous.
2	But the magic was just draining out of him every time he got on that commuter train, back and forth from the suburbs every day.
2	Yeah, he's right, we got to keep moving, Nick.
2	I wanna see you.
2	I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.
2	You got a minute, man?
2	Yeah, I might be going to Yale.
2	You'll see the women in Rio. They're the most beautiful in the world.
2	I don't know what I did to piss this guy off, but he decides he's gonna kill me.
2	Fight!
2	I'm your worst nightmare.
2	Are you sure they're here?
2	I think you will find it interesting, Miss Roffe.
2	It doesn't matter how long it takes, we'll be back in business.
2	Where shall we begin?
2	Now!
2	I go back to Moscow today.
2	Whoa, look at that fish.
2	Will you be needing the car tonight?
2	Oh, we can do lots of things by then.
2	I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.
2	Yeah. Just call me. - When?
2	I'm looking for JR.
2	You see, this'll be my very first own home.
2	That's one of the things I hope the formula will alleviate.
2	I just want to have my shipyard.
2	Yeah, I see him.
2	I'll push, but I don't think you'll see them any sooner.
2	We'll get there.
2	How is she?
2	Yeah, I'd love a cold beer.
2	Can't be worth more than  francs.
2	Dianne, why don't you take your coat off and stay awhile?
2	Came here to play.
2	No!
2	He should be part of our celebration.
2	Mom, are we in Arizona yet?
2	I know what you're going to say.
2	If he resists, arrest him.
2	Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
2	Yeah, but what do you think about the rest of it?
2	Even so, mon ami.
2	Hadn't you better go now?
2	You heard what I said.
2	I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
2	Why?
2	I intend to.
2	What do I do now?
2	I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.
2	While you are studying it, I will eat.
2	You see?
2	I'll make amends.
2	Welcome to Hollywood.
2	I'm having a birthday party Saturday.
2	The last time this witch went to a party, she made the princess prick her finger with a spindle and fall asleep for  years.
2	Did you bring some gold with you?
2	Give me a kiss.
2	Hey! Guess what?
2	We want you to rob drug transport.
2	And what do you say?
2	Let me taste it.
2	You're gonna even that out, aren't you?
2	Egan, break out that chart we've been working on.
2	What's the occasion?
2	So I figured while I'm here I'll lose a few pounds.
2	That's when they come. That's why they're called surprises.
2	You kids play baseball?
2	What's your dream?
2	I thought you'd be onto me if anyone was. ""
2	Hey, Chino.
2	I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers.
2	My friends and I would like to party with five of your girls in Porky's Pen.
2	I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
2	Why, you got something?
2	That'll stop him!
2	Can he present to proof D"?"
2	Have a good time, sweetheart.
2	Y'all ready to go camping?
2	I know how he manipulates.
2	I will start with you.
2	You know, be very close.
2	Doctor, will my brother be able to come home to the farm soon?
2	All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
2	Yes, I'm playing tonight.
2	I wish for you to have a heart.
2	I understand this is a difficult decision but there are human lives at stake, and if help arrives,
2	Check 'em out next time you're in court-- little looks between 'em, smiles.
2	But there's tomorrow.
2	You know we'll do whatever we can.
2	Wanna make me proud, kid?
2	You want a cute little infant.
2	Hope you took your Geritol... 'Cause it's time to dance!
2	You tell him I've got Boone under control.
2	But I'm expecting a courier any minute.
2	Here it comes.
2	Oi!
2	Can't wait to see what the Inspectorate make of it.
2	Y'all will be reading about this.
2	Anything unusual?
2	Gentlemen, how would you all like a mint julep?
2	What time's your bus?
2	I must wait for one year?
2	Really?
2	If they do come here, you will let me know?
2	You know what?
2	Don't want that, now, do we?
2	There's noise coming from upstairs Let's go up for a look
2	You have to come and see us as soon as we get back.
2	Cheese doodles!
2	How long must we wait here?
2	I want to ask you something.
2	I'm in.
2	Get ready.
2	Yes, yes, yes. Shit, I must have.
2	Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
2	You seem personally invested in this.
2	Why can't they jam that?
2	You haven't had the big payday yet.
2	Get down there, son!
2	So, we are definitely on then?
2	What you think?
2	Get the camera on this right now!
2	I would like to come to your camp.
2	Now, please, tell me what I can do.
2	I must have you.
2	You gonna come in soon?
2	But I'll meet you at the Waverly movie theatre.
2	Oh, we are just getting started, Director, and there is a whole lot to comb through.
2	You should be back in New York on time.
2	What the hell does this all mean?
2	Yes, I do.
2	Do it right away.
2	Come to get high? - Yeah.
2	Would you like a little more tea?
2	You will pay me back.
2	Let's get outta here!
2	I hope it's gonna be a hit.
2	Now! Natural, huh? You on your back, huh?
2	The Hundjager I killed was Verrat.
2	Hey.
2	For pocket money he helps some of the older residents with their groceries.
2	We were thinking of getting engaged anyway.
2	What do you expect of me?
2	But I will come back.
2	Did he in you?
2	Boy, that'll be something.
2	I knew it all along though, didn't I? What else it is new, right?
2	We'll relieve you in a couple of hours.
2	I take it you agree that it is possible for a publisher to also be a participant in a sex trafficking venture, where the pimp himself runs a website.
2	I'll have a ginger ale with a twist of lemon.
2	I headed into the English old country Looking for help.
2	We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.
2	Here on the ocean floor is the only independence.
2	You should just get over what happened to you in your adolescence. It is time to move on.
2	Now, if you don't, then I will suspend you.
2	Where are these kind souls that are supposed to help us?
2	Now that you got that, we must teach you how to dress.
2	Can he stay here for a couple of days?
2	Can you play the balalaika? Can she play?
2	Who's our host?
2	We'll be getting into Chihuahua tonight.
2	But I think you'll enjoy his game.
2	Yeah.
2	I'm gonna get her.
2	Oh... you should do it.
2	Are we there yet?
2	Are a sound mind and a full belly.
2	I don't care, it's not mine.
2	Do whatever you got to do to get him into that ring!
2	Get back here!
2	Come with.
2	Scramble the best spin team we have.
2	In case I want to read it more than once.
2	Listen, maybe you and I could get together sometime after Edward leaves.
2	As she told me of all the things that they did to protect children.
2	Here, take a look at this.
2	You should really count it, you know.
2	We'll be OK.
2	If you can get to his phones, we'll have our leads.
2	What'll they say?
2	Another day or two, we'll know for sure who it is.
2	Don't change the station.
2	All right, boys and girls, come on out.
2	How could you let her do a thing like this? What?
2	With a ring like that I could, dare I say it, rule the world.
2	Got it?
2	Did somebody die or lose money or something?
2	You find it hard to believe that this is not just a dream you dreamed a long time ago.
2	Oh no, I think that's a big mistake. I think you should do it.
2	Boone?
2	I can turn myself on a dozen different ways.
2	I should say not.
2	What beast are you talking about?
2	Majesty I can present ... my young daughter, the new Countess of Verua?
2	Willy will soon be here.
2	Let's get him!
2	You know, I think I'll start reviving that tomorrow.
2	I have more power in this hand than all you fucking know.
2	But I won't know till tomorrow, along about noon.
2	Can I help, or would you like to leave a message?
2	Feel the burn. Let me get you a drink.
2	You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
2	Check it out.
2	But I will come back.
2	The State calls Detective Morris Dickerman.
2	Where is she?
2	I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
2	l'll bring Valentin and one other.
2	I wanna go to Chicago.
2	Tom, it's me.
2	That's right! If anyone can get us out of this scrape, it's old Berno!
2	British Intelligence showed you the letter for the first time in Lisbon?
2	I hope this hurts.
2	Your Highness slept well?
2	Coffee will be ready soon.
2	May I ask you a question?
2	Can you, can you, can you, meet me, please.
2	Oh, I'll get the hang of it soon.
2	Hey, professor! Where are you goin'?
2	What are you wearing my coat for?
2	Come on in.
2	Yeah.
2	And you and I are going out together.
2	The fact that you don't drink at all, Kirk, is the greatest argument for drunkenness I know.
2	I can't wait to see their faces light up.
2	I set up a lunch for you at The Pierre.
2	I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
2	I'll do everything I can to make a success of it.
2	Or merely a lack of imagination?
2	How far back do you and he go?
2	You'll thank me when you're free.
2	Thank you.
2	I do not count, only King account.
2	Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free, that is until... Dead Dingo Pass.
2	Help me with these eggs, will you? -Sure.
2	I want a monster truck.
2	No. - Really not?
2	Did anybody ever tell you that you smell like Catalina?
2	What is...
2	Now, today...
2	Here comes another truck!
2	My life now only has room for truth.
2	I have something.
2	I'll meet you after where we said.
2	How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
2	So what else is new?
2	Do you have a boyfriend?
2	We're looking forward to a real contest.
2	This is in these documents, it is.
2	I think we make a really good team. - We do.
2	How you doing, Mick?
2	That's excellent.
2	God, it will be so good to be finished with all this.
2	And after dinner we could go...
2	The solutions to Earth's urgent and long-term potential problems are there.
2	( imitates monkey gibbering )
2	But in no time at all, you'll be soldiers.
2	Let's get married.
2	I've come to take care of you and your brother.
2	Every last drop.
2	The van is waiting to take you to your "Live at Noon" spot.
2	They are against you, and against me.
2	What's the matter?
2	There's nothing more wonderful than children playing, hearing them laughing.
2	Promise me that you are not a spy, and then I will make you a promise in return.
2	Count could teach me of Verua.
2	Are you ready?
2	Your time comes again.
2	Why don't I save you the trouble?
2	A little further.
2	Do not be afraid.
2	I can sit.
2	Left! Turn left!
2	Stay away from...
2	Might take a few days to finalize, but yeah. It's happening.
2	I'll win something.
2	Wait till you see this.
2	How'd you get in there?
2	My ambition is to win all your contracts, own this club and run it my way.
2	I want Dad's yacht fueled and ready for two weeks at Catalina by the time I get there.
2	Whoever it was The family honor him Verua prevent flaunt it.
2	I thought that's when my life really began.
2	One of these days, I'll get the facts and print them.
2	It still has the keys, Mr. Poirot? - Oui.
2	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel.
2	Try me.
2	Why are all in need to run after anything.
2	I'll see you later.
2	She just had a real spice for life.
2	Ardsley will be your next stop!
2	Maybe we better get inside, OK?
2	In the past we've had our differences but I'm sure they can be worked out.
2	When's the next ferry?
2	What's the problem?
2	What do you think? Yeah, that's it.
2	Do you want to come down and hang out or something?
2	I assume cash is acceptable.
2	I'm taking over the bridge.
2	All right? So I'll play you even.
2	Please. Look, this is ridiculous. You do not have to apologize.
2	It's what you got to lose.
2	Why don't you just start talking and let's see how it goes?
2	I want a room, a big room.
2	( laughter ) Gurning.
2	You gotta go see him.
2	You're not easy to talk to on the phone, so I decided to ambush you.
2	That dated us, all right, but it gave us something to do.
2	Got a guest, fam!
2	I thought we could even get you a new dress
2	There are demons in the court so I must get involved in affairs of state
2	Hey dad!
2	I want everything he's got.
2	Save the jokes. He wants to see you.
2	I want to be a great dad.
2	Hello. Graham, is that you?
2	One last compliment, okay?
2	This is the calendar for the day.
2	Yeah, but you're going to win.
2	Come on inside.
2	Darling, is that you?
2	I want everything he's got.
2	I wanna do you.
2	Real men always have .
2	How'd it go?
2	So, come on, give me the gun.
2	We'll keep her here, won't we?
2	Mom. Nice to see you. -Hello.
2	Hold him!
2	Go ahead.
2	I mean, I want to be something besides just a plain fighter... even though Murdock is a champ and a swell guy.
2	The pilots are up early for squadron exercises.
2	This is something that nobody has ever heard about or seen before.
2	You wanted big... real big.
2	This is the calendar for the day.
2	Don't give up, Cody!
2	Get the whole state moving!
2	You're gonna love them.
2	How do you know I wouldn't miss it?
2	Do you like the song?
2	Good luck, Mom.
2	All I care about is power and money.
2	Who are they?
2	Let's go!
2	Hop on.
2	If I hurry, perhaps I might even be home in time for tea.
2	l'm feeling much more relaxed now. -Good.
2	The latter, I will be again, because I have managed to reduce a national election down to one state.
2	This should impress the bankers.
2	It's time to update the program and I would like to hear from each one of you.
2	He'll show up.
2	The time in Paris will be so good for you.
2	I understand... The prosecutors have suspicions.
2	Round everybody up, pat them down. Let's get EOD in here. You got it.
2	At that point, I pulled out the phone book and I started contacting attorneys.
2	I have heard that is a great swordsman.
2	I thought, l'm in love."
2	I'll tell you something I read once, Myron.
2	What do you say, mayii? And let me keep this soul forever? What do you say, mayii?
2	Yeah?
2	We're going to celebrate.
2	I think you'll like it.
2	I want these pots so shiny I can see my face in them!
2	The chaplain will pray.
2	Don't have a boyfriend?
2	When the war's over, Ashley.
2	Tell him I can't insult the owner with such an offer.
2	Well?
2	You'll know...
2	Well, maybe you can help me.
2	Got a chance of a job there?
2	Yes.
2	Let him go.
2	He's inside!
2	Quick! Quick!
2	I don't have to get any place but out. Share a cab?
2	Hands up!
2	Profane, or really offensive?
2	Miss Beckett, I've been looking for you.
2	What was that shooting just now, Chip?
2	She's using what she read in the paper to get attention or a little cash.
2	When you come back, you got good jobs.
2	Smash it! Rip it!
2	I want to ask you something.
2	That's a dream worth living for.
2	Won't you change your mind and stay for dinner, Mr. Dawes?
2	I found something out yesterday.
2	Yes, yes? Is it true that priests and nuns Have orgies in the Vatican?
2	Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
2	General, our discoveries will change the outcome of the war.
2	Deal them up, Shooter.
2	Are you human?
2	The Secretary of State is here. Madam Secretary.
2	Nick's not home but I am, and the front door's unlocked.
2	You will, Marlowe, you will.
2	♪ Got a whale of a tale to tell you, boys ♪
2	I got it all planned.
2	Which we don't care about losing, by the way.
2	What do you know?
2	And a special welcome to Mayor Kuzak and the outgoing administration.
2	There's a gas pump out by the shed.
2	I'll go back to Chicago and be a Fuller Brush girl.
2	Come to the beach tomorrow.
2	Are you ready, boy?
2	Mike was just telling us what cojones he got.
2	Should we call him?
2	Now that you have our city, what do you want with it?
2	Doesn't it blow your mind?
2	King's Cross, please.
2	Amine, can you hear me?
2	Here, in abundance, were various substances Necessary to sustain life...
2	In fact, I'm not doing anything tomorrow.
2	Tell her about our special student housing program.
2	Okay, so all we need to do is get that message out, and...
2	Then I'll take her a petticoat.
2	We're going to start with the high board.
2	Or hunting. You prefer hunting?
2	Finally.
2	Hey, please, just hear me.
2	We can take blood from anything if it's coming to us.
2	We're not gonna forfeit.
2	What can I do for you?
2	See anything you like?
2	Hey, would you like a-a flabellina oculina?
2	I have a soft spot for that patriotic stuff.
2	Do you remember what sins?
2	Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
2	Yeah, I got it.
2	He sounds terrific.
2	First, let's find them.
2	Unless you wanted me to stay.
2	Oh, and I need a can of Maxwell House.
2	Recite the scriptures with me!
2	That's right, babies.
2	What if Jack's not gone?
2	Don't resist us.
2	So I guess growing up in the wetback section of Fresno wasn't that bad.
2	Hey, you son of a bitch! What the--?
2	Personally, I think the Kid's chances are better.
2	Have you talked to Nick?
2	That's my secret.
2	We'd be pleased if you would.
2	See you later.
2	I think that both Rommel and I can promise you a very interesting week ahead.
2	Tell the King ... that try to forgive him.
2	I have a business proposition for you.
2	It's a nice sentimental gesture, CinCPac sending your old cruiser.
2	Did you sleep well?
2	The questions will float to the surface.
2	Enjoy your stay in Australia.
2	Have you ever danced with anyone before?
2	Go ahead, bet your sixes, buster.
2	Tricks?
2	What is it?
2	I want my  million.
2	So we know where to look.
2	That's good.
2	Hi. Come on, dad, let's play! Come on, dad, please, let's play.
2	If you come with me into the other room, I'll show you my idea... if you'll show me yours.
2	What's the action?
2	There is so somewhat to do.
2	I want one! Cuts along on a jolly clip too, doesn't she?
2	Mike, I'm just trying to help you.
2	Wanna hear what I wrote about you?
2	What news have you from the factory, dear?
2	Let's get on with this.
2	I wanna hurt him! I wanna suck out his eyes!
2	I just said, let's have some lunch.
2	Tommy needed my help.
2	I thought we'd celebrate. Going to take us to dinner?
2	I'll come back to see you very soon, and I'll write often.
2	It's not a role. It's a job, a rent-paying job. Now come on;
2	The State offers as evidence... From the defendant's suitcoat... A hair identified by the Police Crime Lab as that of the deceased.
2	How about update tomorrow?
2	Yeah, are you gonna feed her?
2	Come on, come on, where's the tape?
2	The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
2	Girly, let's go!
2	Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance.
2	And now I really need a drink.
2	You want some vodka?
2	Kiddo, I've got to move some cars,
2	I am looking for blue jeans.
2	It's Louie! Louie Vinchenzi from San Francisco.
2	Mrs. Stubbs!
2	You're breaking my fucking arm! - Hurry!
2	Let's go downstairs and celebrate.
2	I want to talk to my brothers.
2	Then rising is better.
2	Her Majesty the Queen!
2	Bingo. You've got a right to open your collar, take off your shoes and relax in Las Vegas for the rest of your life.
2	After them...slowly!
2	I'm taking over the LA office.
2	I don't care what it is, as long as it floats.
2	They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you.
2	I was gonna fix some chow. Wanna join me?
2	Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too, or maybe he doesn't want to know.
2	Been here long?
2	I just got this brainstorm in the middle of the night and... funny how that happens sometimes.
2	Those people have a tough time.
2	Don't start without me.
2	First, I would like to take off my hat.
2	He must have killed a man.
2	They'll be here tomorrow, honey.
2	Time's getting short.
2	I'm going right down.
2	Let's see what Rosario has for dinner.
2	Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you... Any reservations about Harold Greer's abilities?
2	Anyway, last year he comes to me. He wants some names checked out. Who was where, who's doing what.
2	We'll head into the wind.
2	Ain't no doubt about your gender, girly.
2	Uh, Adams? Here.
2	I'll wait for you upstairs.
2	Well, if it won't wake up the kids.
2	They made you one of them, you can do the same for me.
2	So, what do you think?
2	Alas... Scalpel.
2	And now if... When we get a cab we can complete the plan and live out our lives with a modicum of dignity.
2	You're light again, George.
2	This magnificent structure will be the seat of leadership for the new Detroit.
2	Right away.
2	They'd never find me.
2	To find out whether you're a gambler or a trainer.
2	He's so cute.
2	They're here.
2	It'll save my life.
2	How do you play stud, Marlowe?
2	And when things die, they go some place else.
2	Here, in the house of God.
2	Tonight, we go and make party.
2	Don't you want to hear the rest of it?
2	Any chance you could tidy up my trailer while I'm gone?
2	Oh, this is so cool!
2	The directors can't wait for these reports.
2	Well, some other time, then?
2	May I see it?
2	So, where are we all off to?
2	Come on!
2	Loomis, could we have two seconds alone?
2	And there's this great Cézanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce.
2	I'll get my dinner.
2	We got to find Atreyu.
2	All right, get ready. This is it.
2	I know you will.
2	Is he dead?
2	I need you to tell me where Theresa Rubel is. Theresa Rubel.
2	You're gonna be fine.
2	Let's have it.
2	See you tomorrow.
2	Come on, the tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.
2	What do you want to see tonight?
2	I'm taking the next plane home.
2	How about the movies?
2	What's happening?
2	What's wrong?
2	How about two foursomes of golf, huh?
2	Was this clown such a bad guy?
2	How did that happen?

2	All my friends will be there.
2	Go! Go!
2	Where'd they go?
2	Let's go get them, baby.
2	Go ahead, man to man.
2	In the dirt, it's hard to tell.
2	Will you be back for breakfast?
2	They can't go very fast.
2	Knew we'd be too obsessed by the perpetrator inside the bank to see much more than a beard or a blond or a whiny jerk. What do you got?
2	Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake?
2	Never forget that Satan constantly surrounds us, With but one goal in mind...
2	He'll talk to you.
2	Well, duty calls.

2	Nail it up!
2	I have suffered a few myself-- but we are in this together.
2	I'll meet you there.
2	How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
2	So what happened between you two, then?
2	Do you have a boyfriend?
2	I might break down and dance with you.
2	Stop!
2	Stay here?
2	Still no word from Gibbs?
2	And now, what are we going to do?
2	What's happening?
2	This is what I'd like to have someday.

3	Them Italians came one time and stole half the store.
3	Our steamroller methods are getting too hard for your sensitive soul?

3	Why don't you stay where you belong, in yo-yo land?
3	How do you expect him to pay us?
3	One of my biggest disappointments over the last  years is those who lack the courage of their convictions.
3	They brought their fuckin' toys with 'em!
3	The act of a sick mind with an urge to destroy something young and lovely.
3	I hated you...
3	Look, what you've done.
3	I got a lousy temper and an awful accent. I sound toffee-nosed.
3	You have to be a pig!
3	I'll never eat fish again.
3	Jesus, I wondered who ate these damn things.
3	I'm not going to the chair 'cause that ape got trigger-happy!
3	Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.
3	I know all those stories.
3	That... that seducer and despoiler must be stopped.

3	Hey, what the hell are you going to Frenchy movies for, anyway?
3	Your whole story about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit!
3	Man, what are you, some kind of frog-watcher?
3	A lie.""
3	You go round there and say you're sorry.
3	This was calculated disrespect to your commanding officer.
3	But your love does not match your lust for power.
3	Taylor has every paper lined up and he's feeding them doctored-up junk!
3	One can't expect bloody Yanks to understand.
3	I bet Larren was porking her... And taking the money to keep her in style.
3	That's no good.
3	How this could become part of the legacy of The Village Voice is depressing to me.
3	Sorry, I should have mentioned it.
3	You let everyone sit around while you took your petty revenge?
3	Lousy bank robber, too.
3	No more soap opera.
3	And nice earrings for a streetwalker.

3	The Shakespeare whose testimony nearly sunk us all.
3	Think we should find a rubbish dump or something.
3	Do something please!
3	You're not making any sense.
3	She had been very abused.
3	I can tell when someone lies to me.
3	You knew nothing about DeVriess and you know even less about Queeg.
3	She believes that her father has incestuous desires.
3	Do you think we'd better let it go at that?
3	And this smog doesn't help anyway.
3	You touch her, and the Food and Drug Administration gets you for fuckin' food.
3	Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires?
3	Don't lie to me, you pepper gut.
3	You can't even cook my breakfast.
3	Maybe a little noisier.
3	Sergei is no friend.
3	Next time you try that, I'll forget that you're a woman.

3	Don't you ever say that to me again.
3	I ain't aiming for you to go to John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
3	Polhemus was bad news.
3	And no promises on the sentence.

3	There's not enough bleach to burn the stench of you away, Luke Dove.
3	Now, the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith.
3	Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife.
3	The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.

3	She never asks for money, but somehow she always happens to help grateful rich people.
3	Yes, well, she's a stupid woman.
3	Everybody's a screwball in some way.
3	I'll disinherit him.
3	He's lying.
3	The professor has been misquoted outrageously.
3	Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances.
3	No, no. - No interference from us, right?

3	Shit happens.
3	I don't care what she looks like. I don't like the company she keeps.
3	Course they gave him a big hunk of money for a settlement. Don't nobody know how much it was.

3	Headless corpses.
3	The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party.
3	I said, Are you fucking crazy?""
3	If he can't find enough facts to break you with, I'll give him a couple.

3	That's entirely... why don't you bring Melanie in to make sure the phone gets answered?
3	You're one pain in the ass I don't need.
3	Don't be a fool.
3	I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life.
3	It can look like Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care, just as long as I get off this stinking boat!
3	Like I'd ever tell you.
3	What you want?
3	When neighbors call-- Not that they do call... I see them sniffing... sniffing.
3	OK, the same day, I'm reading the Post and there's this item on Bobby Stein, the radio guy who does those gross jokes about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center.
3	Oh, Shooter... tell me... is this young man of yours gonna give me any trouble?
3	He stepped in front of a bullet for me once caught it in his left hand and shoved it up the punk's ass.

3	And as for taxes, how many millions have you in tax-exempt bonds and oil wells, whose power of production your government so generously protects, while it denies similar benefits to the human brain?
3	They seem so childish.
3	This life is not only wicked and sinful.
3	Don't Freud me, Gibbs. You're not qualified.
3	Hasn't got a halfpenny to his name.
3	It's not going to go that far.
3	If I thought I made you feel like that, I'd kill myself.
3	Nothing doing.
3	Go call your pimp to look after you!
3	She has cellulite. I wish we could get her to stop eating so much.
3	Are you fucking crazy?
3	There'll be no more talk of the captain being crazy.
3	How can you be so inhuman?
3	I swear that man moves like dead lice were falling off him.
3	Can't pay his bills.
3	Coco sounds like she caught the old man cheating again.
3	Look, lon, what you did to me with this woman.
3	You know, you're too stupid to even be a good bigot.
3	that are  years beyond what you could comprehend."
3	You're just spoiled. You've thrown everything away.
3	Like disposing of their wives?
3	So, now I'm supposed to roll over like a bitch dog getting my belly scratched?
3	The part that really bothered me was the part where he indicated that,
3	Help yourself.
3	I bet you don't even like girls, do you?
3	Before proceeding further, I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such.
3	You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body.
3	You think I don't know why you got me down here on this cockamamie case?
3	Stop calling me, please.
3	Don't be such a noodle.
3	That ought to teach those Moonies to stay away from my house.
3	Do you have to cheat at everything?
3	Come on, cut that shit out.
3	Would you really wear a thing like that?
3	You know, I'm getting damn tired of your misplaced admiration.
3	Either way, murder or suicide, I'd say he deserved it, wouldn't you?
3	It has happened to me without my wanting, almost without my knowing.
3	I'm so bored with this face.
3	Yeah, I think you would be decent, With all that account balance bullshit.
3	You make me sick with your heroics.
3	You know, I'm not so fond of raising money, but I think it's idiotic to turn that job over to him.
3	After marrying, clear what...
3	The Senator'll make a good orator when his voice stops changing.
3	You aren't even allowed to look at her with her clothes on.
3	They've been infected with the bacteria.
3	Stronger mouthwash might be nice.
3	Don't you have any principles?
3	Take him!
3	The word is bitch.
3	He pumps his face full of Novocaine, and then, with his scalpel begins to slice away his features one by one.
3	Or you can go straight back to your home on the streets.
3	Do we have to sit with them?
3	Never return to Torino.
3	Out! Get out!
3	How long do you think we'll have to stay in this hellhole?
3	You brat!
3	Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all.
3	He's come for the king. - You snake!
3	Don't talk rot, Clipton.
3	What am I supposed to do, sound like a hick just to make her happy?
3	That old bastard's killed more guys than the electric chair.
3	These heels are grotesque.
3	She's got a witch's brain.
3	We're here to scout, not engage.
3	Or a liar.
3	They must have picked the prize dummy.
3	The feces has struck the air conditioner.
3	She was so fat, when she sat on a drugstore stool, she had a hangover.
3	You are a class-A fuck-up, you know?
3	Think much, pea brain?
3	I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.
3	You dress like this, you attract attention to me.
3	Paulie, do you know what you did?
3	That is bullshit.
3	There's going to be an awful lot of red faces if this policeman does his duty.
3	Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals?
3	Maybe you can hear this. The next time you cross me, you're gonna turn up missing.
3	Another keen son of a bitch.
3	Since then I accuse myself of impure actions.
3	Motherfucker.
3	Our friend" Anton."
3	There'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed.
3	Why did you lie to me?
3	Strange man.
3	Now he takes an utter stranger into the family.
3	Admiral's party approaching.
3	I do not want to hear one more insubordinate word... from anyone in this platoon.
3	That's bad management.
3	Red boy. You know that's a white man thing, innit?
3	Might wash some of the starch out of you, or rust.
3	Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch  flies a day. And that they should be collected, counted and delivered daily, by me.
3	And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there.
3	Are you vulnerable to him in any way?
3	Darn it, Graham.
3	Hey, ass-wipe, All the emo freaks belong on the bleachers. Go!
3	People with money like uniforms.
3	Maybe she even killed my partner, Chris Amador.
3	There's too much loss of life and property damage possible.
3	Hey, you told me the only way you survive is because you're a team.
3	They want to fight and die as martyrs.
3	That's out of our jurisdiction, isn't it?
3	Must be losing it.
3	Any decent church would've burnt you bastards years ago.
3	or even scrap"
3	Which I will never understand.
3	Come on. The whole point of these takeovers is to sell off the assets and put old farts like me out to pasture.
3	We're not interested in him.
3	But, God, people can be rude.
3	Tell me what you gave to him!
3	I'm stuck with guys down here that are too dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill.
3	How stupid.
3	If that slob was a penologist, I'm a jet airplane pilot.
3	You bastard!
3	No need to mock the grave.
3	She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible.
3	Imagine getting gussied up like this to watch a lot of Supreme Court judges chew.
3	I feel all rotten inside.
3	Once that secret mentions the visit of the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space.
3	If this guy has any information, why hasn't he contacted you already?
3	You have till five o'clock.
3	House of Abercrombie and Blair, publishers, drunk or sober.
3	Is this the admiral's harem?
3	No further questions.
3	I don't want this no more.
3	MIT was after me, wanted me to rule the world for them.
3	We've always embraced the very things for which others have burned you at the stake.
3	Don't get too used to those long lunches.
3	Fine. You win.
3	The way you've ignored us, you wouldn't think so.
3	Except you honked the fucking horn.
3	Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
3	You're too little and weak, like a girl.
3	The man who blows his own horn.
3	Yeah, right.
3	Don't you find that kind of disturbing?
3	Nothing at Kennedy.
3	You're a killer!
3	Bring him.
3	Now...
3	Without their guns, they're nothing at all.
3	Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.
3	Don't let that cop get away with this.
3	At this rate, we'll have to head home inside  hours.
3	Why are you smiling, you silly bastard?
3	No! No! No!
3	Look at us. You feel cursed because you were born with it.
3	Yes, you may think that we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.
3	Everything seems to have a bite to it, and I'm smelling like an old sheepherder.
3	Well, when you are fat, you don't move so fast.
3	Nobody cares.
3	We're going to lose a man like Mike here for that?
3	Which one of you killed my dog?
3	This greaser was just trying to tell me how to run my business.
3	You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?
3	It is absurd!
3	You're not gonna have a country that can make these kinds of rules work, if you haven't got men who can tell human rights from a punch in the nose.
3	Never has deposited it. Like I say, he's a nut.
3	At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in.
3	Take your mind off my work.
3	Don't you think I know how you plan to get out?
3	A boy that I watched grow up was in that car that you threw the hornets into.
3	You have a great talent for creating difficult situations.
3	Now that's... not a great deal of effort for more money than you ever dreamed of. And no risk... no risk to you at all.
3	Weak, a go-alonger, no character!
3	I gotta jet. Really?
3	Maybe going on the wagon makes a man dull.
3	Kind of reckless of you.
3	That's not music.
3	A woman who drinks is bad enough and I will not stand for a woman cursing and blaspheming God.
3	I've been to that scumbag town.
3	These videos were posted together with instructions from the kidnappers.
3	It wouldn't take that long if we had the right kind of government.
3	Poor little rich boy.""
3	A manicure and a haircut wouldn't do any harm.
3	It seems, Passelewe, that my subjects are becoming a pain in the arse.
3	I love tits as much as any guy... ..but why would I pay some hag money for some supernatural chicanery... ..coupled with sagging, wrinkled boobs?
3	Oh, my boobs are killing me.
3	She puts the same information out there, Collects her paycheck, and somehow she sleeps at night.
3	You're listening to a piece of shit like Bobby Tex.
3	Until a trial... When she sees her husband suffer... The way she never...
3	You're an operator, not a policymaker. Get used to it.
3	Hey, freak-face, we found your pals.
3	Too much vodka.
3	This is all a cover-up.
3	You must have one idea for the good of the country.
3	Don't be sure.
3	That high is not the one you're looking for. Believe me.
3	A setup!
3	Yeah, and...
3	workingmen stand ready for work on Monday... on the largest slaughterhouse outside Chicago.""
3	Who's afraid of a little booger?
3	He swears he has no idea where Edith is, but his phone records tell a different story.
3	Now he takes an utter stranger into the family.
3	Go home.
3	When the country needs men who have courage like never before, he's just gonna decorate a chair and get himself honoured.
3	Who else worries about another male like that except a [GAY SLUR]?
3	And I hate these fucking doughnuts.
3	How can you be so mean?
3	And if one more guy makes a pass at me, I'm going to sock him in the face.
3	For God's sake, June!
3	What the hell am I living around here for?"
3	Stay with my mother?
3	Let's shove off!
3	What do you dream about?
3	She ought to be melted down for razor blades.
3	You'd crawl over your dying mother to fuck your sister.
3	Max. See that guy out there with the wog?
3	The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking, the more Backpage comes up.
3	It is not educated. Then it repents.
3	As a so called one percenter motorcycle club, Vagos are notoriously violent.
3	Everything you've got!
3	It's disrespectful.
3	It's the son of a bitch who painted this car, that's who. Yeah, that's what a real criminal is.
3	I'm just... so frustrated.
3	The party's over here. Please. No?
3	Her cunt.
3	As in... pointless.
3	You cannot kill a man's family and talk about human rights.
3	When the country needs men who have courage like never before, he's just gonna decorate a chair and get himself honoured.
3	when you want to kill something.""
3	You naughty boys.
3	I want to go home, now. I'll talk to Nat.
3	We're human beings, you know.
3	Do you know what they say about girls who play?
3	Nothing but talk.
3	You think I like playing sick little games with you?
3	I've been aboard the Caine too long.
3	Come on, don't be a fool.
3	Would you stop harrassing her? But if you'll let me point out that my client's mental state...
3	Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?
3	They're trying to take his old man's land.
3	The man with the sweat was more pleasant than you.
3	Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman.
3	It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood, in every city and state in the country.
3	You may join the others belonging to my uncle... and henceforth you may take your orders from him.
3	Murdering unarmed men?
3	Do your friends put money in your pocket, Pino?
3	As it happens, you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it.
3	The Senator'll make a good orator when his voice stops changing.
3	You beast.
3	I'm afraid the press has been alerted to your mother's presence here... -...and her arrest. -Oh, great.
3	To begin with, a thief.
3	Think God punishes the King to have a French whore.
3	I'm gonna leave you alone for a little while.
3	And not for Mr Blair, love him as I may.
3	Stupid.
3	You know, Melanie, I've just remembered I've got quite a lot of work to do tonight, so I think I'll be going.
3	Don't you have any respect for yourself?
3	No doubt the fellow is an impostor.
3	He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never bothered to stop his car.
3	If you don't let go, I'll...
3	He said that to scare us.
3	Do what?
3	Never!
3	For a moment, I thought you were a man.
3	They climbed down the damn chimney.
3	How many deals do you think get cut in the men's room?
3	No. That's another lie, isn't it?
3	Can you believe it? It's too tacky.
3	All she could do was drink and cry, like you.
3	The deal with Tusk was a mistake.
3	Who's talking about cowardice?
3	Why don't you like him?
3	Anything that man tells me will be a lie.
3	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
3	I got enough to put you away for a long vacation. So like it or not, as of now you're working for me, understand?
3	You're murderers!
3	Dear, a mere child.
3	Of course I'm sweating, you moron.
3	These images will pollute us.
3	Your old man's a punk.
3	But hair just keeps on sprouting.
3	They say he's got a brain.
3	She said that I put on airs. That I use big words like gesture" and "devastate.""
3	You are the fool, Mr Howie.
3	I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me, sir.
3	Rape, sex crimes, child molestation.
3	Why do men think marriage is the only thing we want?
3	Hey, Dal, while you're down there trying to figure out the female race... you might as well take a bath.
3	Enough with the water.
3	I hate bankers.
3	You dumb bastard, why didn't you get some girl off the streets?
3	There's nothing more commercial than a long-shot comeback of a down-on-his-luck underdog.
3	Just because it is big and white and a yacht, is it not still dirt?
3	People can be goddamn cruel.
3	Do not lie you know, Jeanne.
3	Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals?
3	You're not even real ghosts!
3	Your manuscript went astray, that's all.
3	Oh, Christ. Don't patronize me.
3	Never mind.
3	And shave off that dreadful moustache.
3	And sometimes I think some junkie nurse may be stepping on my medication.
3	He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times, and how, on the night of the murder, she not only smashed his radio but hit him.
3	She even had her baby screaming at us.
3	You!
3	And when I'm dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience irks you.
3	By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck, there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons!
3	I told you that swords are too dangerous!
3	You have to wash up all over or no dinner.
3	You still serve that dull, grey stupidity.
3	They bite your neck and drink your blood.
3	This is called inbreeding from which comes idiot children... and more lawyers.
3	I'm not some gun for hire.
3	I know exactly where I am.
3	And I refuse to assist you in the rape of the Earth.
3	You look like someone who could use a couple of hours' sleep.
3	Wow. - I missed that one.
3	I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face.
3	That Dude ought to be ashamed of himself.
3	He's lying, mom.
3	You can't buy people's souls.
3	That's disgusting!
3	Women don't belong in the dressing room!
3	Anybody connected with drugs deserves to die.
3	Or it might've just fallen overboard dropped there by some drunken old rummy.
3	A man who would come here as a virgin.
3	Come on...
3	Bitch.
3	I'm such a pain in the ass these days I deserve myself.
3	How this could become part of the legacy of The Village Voice is depressing to me.
3	If there was a bum within  miles, I was completely attracted to him.
3	Nobody eats that shit.
3	This is not behaving in a company way.
3	Younger Bear was just trying to hand me the worst possible insult.
3	You're crazier than a mule-humping goat.
3	Your plastic's not gonna help you now, you lousy little fuck.
3	You took him to a freaky fortune lady who scared the shit...
3	It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
3	I do not know what you are, but you are not a woman.
3	But he's talking about the illegal part of it.
3	You're much too smart, aren't you?
3	Nice tits, sure, But a face I wouldn't want to Wipe my feet on.
3	Boys, sweep them out of the gutter.
3	It's just all too much right now. You know, I just...
3	It's over.
3	He swallowed his key.
3	It's like working in a filling station, watching the cars go by.
3	Better you than your mother.
3	An evil spirit took by corpse and won't let me rest in peace
3	You told me you were taking me home.
3	Obscenely decaying flesh.
3	You don't fuck with my box!
3	She seems very unusual. -Yeah.
3	I'm getting leery of this guy.
3	Well, the tall guy is not really a friend.
3	No.
3	They gotta know Mario's gonna pull out their livers.
3	Touch me and I'll sue.
3	Burn them all away.
3	She will! You're listening to a sick girl!
3	Have you been drinking?
3	You don't care about Leningrad, do you?
3	That's a foolish article of yours.
3	Kirk, Maria has made a chump out of you.
3	You're not gonna see the sunset over there.
3	Look at that shit.
3	They'll never survive without their mother. Well.
3	Christ. What a dump.
3	Disgusting.
3	Silence this fool, Menelaus.
3	How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins?
3	Touch me and I'll sue.
3	And you agree?
3	And what she did was she... Brought her into a life of hell.
3	Where do they get this crap?
3	I'm ashamed of you, Amanda.
3	Should I just stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek dam appropriation around my neck?
3	We need to talk and actually catch up, But... I feel weird about this.
3	Brian, you don't like this job any more than I do, do you?
3	... Primitive
3	It's such a ridiculous...
3	What the hell does that mean?
3	What do you mean you didn't see?
3	She is the most immoral young lady I have ever seen.
3	You stay and cook one of your raw dinners.
3	I work with a junkie?
3	I'm doing everything in my power not to fire you.
3	It's me, you fool.
3	I'm listening to you eat.
3	I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.
3	The coward's code!
3	Oh, this idiot?
3	It's people who should be blamed for the filth, not the river.
3	Seventeen to you, Philly.
3	They expect me to cut my finger off.
3	If we can force them to come in and face us, we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape.
3	Stripped of all that it's no wonder they become suicidal.
3	Where in the hell is justice?
3	These words are useless.
3	Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
3	Finish her!
3	You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle?
3	I want to get away from you cops and wops and junkies.
3	They were bred for degeneracy.
3	What are you doing with that piece of sheep dip?
3	You're gonna die.
3	You're sorry?
3	That's Henry park, Mr. computer from downstairs. Some of the hardware is so outdated.
3	I never should've left.
3	And that you not only look like, but you are, a mess of worms.
3	It can't be so hard to die.
3	You better talk to her now.
3	Yeah, she'll wind up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
3	This ought to be rich.
3	Your breath stinks of it.
3	even though it continues to dominate the market for sex ads.
3	Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.
3	Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess.
3	Therefore, owing to circumstances which, believe me, are beyond my control, I hereby advise you not to come to Rome to make the test.
3	Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman.
3	OK.
3	This kid, bulldozing his way into our lives.
3	It's like being in jail.
3	Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?
3	You've murdered a human being!
3	Even before Buddha you refuse to reveal your true appearance!
3	You're my boss, that's it.
3	The Feds pay him $ a month and hands off while he deals his own shit.
3	Well, that depends upon your point of view, professor. What do you mean by that?
3	Bullshit!
3	Daddy. You want to name her daddy?
3	Now, don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
3	You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
3	Oh, hell!
3	He's a prick.
3	Wanted for horse-thieving down in Seven Rivers, ain't you?
3	Hey. What the hell was that?
3	You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see.
3	All right, you rat prick.
3	The natives over there are cannibals.
3	Well, it's, very kind of you...
3	Now, keep your mouth shut until you can say something suitable.
3	Silly old man looking after that young thing.
3	Ever since Case took over the firm.
3	Then why the hell are we here?
3	If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart...
3	Riskin' your life for that little fucker!
3	You think you can laugh me out of it as if I were a child.
3	That guy seems like a real piece of work.
3	You're hanging your ass out a good long way on this one.
3	It's all that's left of him now. Just a box of bits and pieces.
3	This guy's a phony, Cody.
3	Till I had to put a stop to that myself!
3	Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you.
3	I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this.
3	You will live to regret this day.
3	I didn't believe in the prophecies.
3	He wants to meet with you. Today. - Why?
3	He that is himself a confessed traitor.
3	For three months, we've been listening to that sad sack spout his unhinged tirades, day in and day out, because we were promised % of the ransom.
3	I should have fired him when we fired Nico.
3	Those wicked detectives...
3	This is ridiculous.
3	Don't point that fucking thing at me. Take it off.
3	Then stop calling me.
3	You're kidding me.
3	Profane, or really offensive?
3	If you ask me, this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen.
3	More money for the Pentagon when it's own auditors admit the military cannot account for % of what it already spends.
3	Oh, it tastes bitter.
3	If you officers know what's good for you, tell them to stop.
3	Someone at Roffe gave or sold highly secret research material to four competitive firms.
3	If you're dirty, you're going.
3	He thought it was sinful.
3	And a nose just like a rudder.
3	All you want is my money.
3	You haven't got the balls to boycott me.
3	I shouldn't be this drunk.
3	I'm in the shithouse.
3	It's a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison.
3	I am sure you will find her in the fraternity house.
3	I'm not stupid, OK?
3	They contacted me to feel me out, and to tell me what wonderful people they were, and how their founders were really cool guys from Greenwich Village, and what did I know about that.
3	One of the many troubles with you, Harry, is, you never know where your movie scripts leave off and life begins.
3	Our steamroller methods are getting too hard for your sensitive soul?
3	Anyway, the president of this teamster local back east set up a phony welfare fund, right?
3	Then I turn my back, and he steals a glass.
3	Outside the French whore!
3	Pervert.
3	Why don't you tell the truth for once?
3	How do you plan to pass if you're too busy stealing cars And shooting black people?
3	The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.
3	You're not just a crook, but a murderer.
3	Put these in water, blabbermouth!
3	She looks like a jelly doughnut, doesn't she?
3	That's ridiculous.
3	That's incest!
3	I can hardly wait for you to grow up.
3	You know, we knew you was a punk then, but you're being a punk now.
3	The dishes are on the table, the refrigerator door was open...
3	The gun, honey dripper.
3	How could they with you here?
3	I don't like this.
3	In fact, we have so much evidence that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force, stated that it's an embarrassment of riches.
3	Irritating little sod.
3	Is she crazy or what?
3	Over here!
3	You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent.
3	My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain.
3	That's why your wife dumped you.
3	How about that mess.
3	That's rude.
3	I am going to throw up.
3	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
3	You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation.
3	You dare hold your queen up to ridicule?
3	So much you had to take up with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.
3	Because we are food for worms, lads.
3	Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you?
3	It is of no concern to me
3	Why, Grey, what a thing to say!
3	Mr Deveraux, you've really chapped my ass and I've had just about enough.
3	Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
3	I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife.
3	You think you have free license to be insulting?
3	And as long as you terrorize me, I'm gonna fight you.
3	Liar!
3	Crazy out of your skull.
3	You come from somewhere and you're trying to make nothing out of yours.
3	If I catch any of you guys in my stuff, I'll kill you.
3	That bitch has messed around with me.
3	It's crazy.
3	You want to hurt me? You already did.
3	Montana to Mexico City, hauling shit for assholes.
3	Well?
3	So you just hang out and keep a look at kids?
3	And without Sam, it's better to let these people with the black suits and the Swiss haircuts worry about things you and I don't begin to understand.
3	Cain's bugging me.
3	You envy us. And what you envy...
3	Shut the fuck up.
3	I just hate to hear you blaspheme.
3	Shit food!
3	I have asked you here to meet the woman selected to represent the most discriminating publication in the world, Quality.
3	I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
3	It's blackmail, pure and simple.
3	These notes led you to tell Detective Lipranzer... That the murderer was sterile?
3	I know you... you murdering son of a bitch.
3	My champagne is not properly cooled.
3	I made a deal with a cop once.
3	But no, you had to be your stupid, stubborn, son of a bitch self.
3	I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp!
3	Silly old man looking after that young thing.
3	After we get to the capital whatever the emperor does to you is not me responsibility
3	You must be crazy.
3	Now you're going to fuckin' die.
3	It's an insult.
3	Damnedest thing I ever did see.
3	I demand that you free the Childlike Empress!
3	Hurry up, suckers, you're dragging!
3	You'd prefer the parents dead, too.
3	This one is getting too popular.
3	I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them.
3	You didn't have to do that.
3	Don't give me all that sally army stuff.
3	I'm gonna tell.
3	Why don't you tell the truth for once?
3	That makes no sense.
3	The asshole's got files on me.
3	Sucker!
3	God knows why, but they want this strike.
3	You sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you?
3	I think he's right. - I don't want to hear it!
3	But it's not real.
3	This asshole from the coroner's wants her on two stretchers.
3	Have you thought for a moment about her?
3	What a gruesome proof of the power of the press.
3	After that pathetic scene in the parking lot, she is fucked and should resign.
3	You and Marie are a couple of sluts.
3	I just don't fit behind a desk, I I'm not cut out for it, I feel dry-docked.
3	What horror!
3	What is important about that action is that it was a number of Fortune  companies telling that business, that they believe there is illegal conduct happening and they weren't gonna support it.
3	Get the fuck back!
3	Ugh! Shocking!
3	With my hand out, not in million years.
3	If you want to cite law, then obey it yourself.
3	What if the Russians were raping your sister?
3	Well, we're there for the oil. Let's not pretend.
3	Alright, have it any way you want!
3	If David comes back, I'll give him a bust right in the mouth.
3	You talk like a madman.
3	I can't believe that you believe that.
3	You made Case feel like shit tonight 'cause he was scared.
3	I was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there.
3	I know all about you, back from your first fight with Apollo Creed.
3	And what are you focused on now?
3	It's useless.
3	Well, well, well. What do we have here?
3	If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice...
3	Where'd he touch you, boy?
3	She's got an indiscreet voice.
3	Where's Graham? Who cares?
3	What are you guys, a bunch of cripples?
3	Well, you did Dale, you stuck it up there,
3	Oh, no. That won't do.
3	But hell, what a cop.
3	I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England... from an unclean tyrant.
3	I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him.
3	And I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away.
3	You have not even taken off his shoes.
3	I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
3	He's such a liar.
3	You rinse, you get this glob of plaque you gotta spit out.
3	That's your funeral.
3	They're in Underwood's pocket.
3	You are a coward like all other people, aren't you?
3	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
3	What the fuck are you doing now, man?
3	Instant gratification takes too long.
3	I regret the things that I done.
3	It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
3	What kind of a system is this? Can you move these cars out of here?
3	You've nothin to bitch about!
3	I hate when you use the word "superfluous".
3	It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is.
3	All right, so we got ourselves a real live rat, right?
3	Is that what they taught you at Yale Law School?
3	He laid me out, strung me up and then...
3	Give us a statement! Dozens are dead.
3	He looks like a drunk.
3	You're making me sick!
3	I knew I couldn't trust you.
3	Remember what I told you about court? Yeah.
3	Milo, I'm gonna kill you, you murdering son of a bitch!
3	And m the tooth fairy."
3	Mom said sleeping with you was like sleeping with a salad with bad dressing!
3	But you needn't go on account of this idiot.
3	He shot himself.
3	Only a gourd-head would ask a stupid question like that.
3	You ain't no Captain you and sure as hell ain't no Robin Hood.
3	So here you have a major country, a nuclear power, making a commitment to do this.
3	Just get the head.
3	Ouch! That was the antigravity backdrop.
3	Why did I ever trust you?
3	Ah, he's peeing on me!
3	Nick, Nick, Nick.
3	You seem easily impressed by numbers, captain.
3	Come here, you lazy, no-good son of mine!
3	You're a trained killer!
3	I think Mr Entwhistle is disturbed because he can't take you to the party and dance all over your feet.
3	Give him a break, would you?
3	I can't let that happen again.
3	You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle?
3	He tries to prove he's a real man and he's not.
3	You've failed.
3	You're suffering from small eyes and fat asses.
3	You got bird shit in your hair.
3	Those two lovebirds next door driving you nuts?
3	I call it to your attention that only one of you has reported here this morning properly dressed.
3	If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice...
3	This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.
3	This starved duck?
3	No, no, no. Shit.
3	Calm down, fam!
3	Their screams... you never forget something like that.
3	Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.
3	Just find him.
3	I'll make Miami look like a little place where the monks live.
3	Then, you know you've got a shitty witness.
3	Just get it over with.
3	A couple months in solitary will cool you off, bugger.
3	I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society.
3	I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
3	I do not like this side of you.
3	I don't get your generation's humour.
3	I can't stand this spic shit.
3	Goddamn little bitch secretary.
3	Keep Smith away from anything that smacks of politics.
3	That's the man that eats people
3	Why don't you get a fucking life?
3	I give up!
3	Oysters are out of season.
3	Yeah, yeah, yeah...
3	Play fair with me, fat man.
3	Men will believe anything, the more preposterous the better.
3	The man has the biggest murder case in the city... And he has to kiss your ring?
3	I don't want you on here right now.
3	It cannot sit down in wet cushions.
3	Yes, I know, I know.
3	Turn that trash off!
3	For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission.
3	These men.
3	Don't text me.
3	Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you.
3	I don't think this bullshit's funny.
3	According to some estimates we cannot track . trillion dollars in transactions.
3	And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances, the way he kept admitting over and over that he killed the old lady.
3	I need a minute.
3	I want you to have a heart attack and die so we never have to do this again.
3	Now you're lying.
3	I could do wonders with your dismembered body.
3	Are you sure you want to escape from it?
3	And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it.
3	That sounds worse than it was.
3	What a dump.
3	Don't touch me unless you love me.
3	From a year of war you've become lazy, a drunkard and a coward.
3	What is it with you boys and your war toys?
3	What should we do, moron?
3	Wipe that fucking smile off your face!
3	I've isolated her forever.
3	Don't be fresh, dear.
3	You flaming fucking [GAY SLUR]!
3	And then he says, l sure hope he was guilty." Then he laughs."
3	You'll do your housework, eat chocolates, take care of the kid and you'll put on  or  pounds.
3	It's time you woke up to your responsibilities.
3	I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
3	What the hell is the matter with you?
3	Goddamn, that thing's got more holes than my daddy's rubber.
3	Grow up. Leave your mother.
3	Better than yours.
3	Go to your girlfriend's or a hotel, but don't come home.
3	He hit me.
3	Is this the kind of person that you are?
3	You gotta be a real putz to wear a white coat around here.
3	Let's kill him now.
3	Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek, wham, and it feels like your eye is going to explode?
3	If you don't tell me all you know, you become an accessory before the fact of murder.
3	Later, you fucker!
3	Down with the King.
3	As you say, a foolish article.
3	You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
3	You chickenshit bastard.
3	Oh, sure.  Cry all you want."
3	Coward!
3	For far too long.
3	Jesus christ, man.
3	A rebel.
3	Hey, trust me with your life but not your money or your wife. You're an asshole!
3	You idiot.
3	And we'd like you to explain it to the sister superior.
3	And that, that caused me to do the most dumb-ass thing I've ever done in my life.
3	You're harming them psychologically.
3	It's an incredibly profitable, as horrifying as it is to say, business.
3	This hysterical Hannah who tried to kill her husband.
3	Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you.
3	Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone.
3	You wish you were foolish. Foolish should be a goal of yours.
3	He was a loser too.
3	For you to become a murderer?
3	Three years I've been waiting to nail your sorry ass.
3	This is ridiculous.
3	Then they'll tell him the way to keep his boy from being hanged is to sign over his ranch to them for a quarter of what it's worth.
3	You're liars.
3	Prostitutes will try to tempt you with their unhealthy immorality.
3	If you can find a job, if it pays more than $50,a week... and if you don't get involved with another maniac.
3	Most guys couldn't even handle you.
3	Oh, it's your fault she's gone June,
3	If you stay ten years, you may learn to tell an aircraft from a seagull.
3	Son of a bitch!
3	And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word, but, shit.
3	Almost looked like they were nude.
3	You hit me again and I'm gonna rip your face off.
3	I still insist he's paranoid.
3	I'm just tired.
3	It's a shame, isn't it?
3	I am very busy... please!
4	So what do we do about the hostage situation, sir?
4	I didn't know what to do.
4	They're gonna be tough to run out.
4	I think we're stuck.
4	We need the Sheriff.
4	Sorry for the slight inconvenience, Your Honor.
4	Somebody told me they thought he'd killed a man once.
4	She was coming after me with this gun right in her two hands.
4	Sin.
4	Somehow I had to reach Louise, to survive.
4	The thing is, Loomis, we lost a little time.
4	I was frantic.
4	You're under arrest.
4	( laughter ) woman:
4	You're not robbing this train.
4	I'll die if they send me to prison.
4	I'll tell them anything!
4	What I want you to do is go over to your church, get crosses, and prayer books, and Bibles, and whatever the hell else you people use.
4	Have you got anybody with you?
4	All right. Nobody move.
4	While you two pricks are congratulating yourselves, you better realize maybe you put Brennan's neck in it.
4	Let me go! You can't do this!
4	I warn you, if this case comes to trial, it will be before a French court.
4	Oh, God, please help.
4	Still no word from Gibbs?
4	Another dead end.
4	The perps are still on the train, okay?
4	Not the way it is.
4	Please...
4	But I'm not out of danger yet.
4	It could get you in trouble.
4	I'm going to see my mother before she dies... in Russia.
4	Too bad about those eggs, Joanna.
4	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
4	Let's shove off!
4	Princess Vivian! Come down!
4	Something must have scared him.
4	And then tolerance fades and faith turns to anger.
4	You killed him.
4	Someone's tampering with the security circuits.
4	Such as I was waiting.
4	Well, I-I gotta be going. Uh...
4	They asked me to give it to you.
4	Don't look down!
4	Somethin' wrong with your car?
4	We are all of us caught up in the suspense of this horror fiction.
4	Who are vicious killers?
4	I told you, this can get tough.
4	Well, maybe you can help me.
4	I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.
4	You in? - Uh, sure, I'll shoot a rack with you. - L-listen, kid, kid.
4	A lot of firepower.
4	We are taking The Nautilus down for the last time.
4	What is...
4	Target visible in  seconds.
4	She's got the curse.
4	Something hit us.
4	So me and my partner bolt up the stairs, somebody is screaming bloody murder...
4	He's such a nut about that car and driving fast...
4	The clerk said she left with one of those two Cuban Hebes.
4	Ghosts!
4	I know this is a battle we can't win, and all I ask is that you spare him, he's a good kid.
4	Sweetheart, what are you doing home?
4	They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...
4	What're you gonna do with me?
4	One thing... Admiral Broderick only allowed us  planes...
4	It's your gun, sir?
4	Looks to me like we're in hot water already.
4	We've got to get out of here.
4	But they'll accuse you of helping me escape
4	Defend yourselves!
4	Nothing is guaranteed.
4	I was afraid of that.
4	Go get them and get them quick!
4	Dickson will ruin this bank if we don't stop him.
4	I'm not opening that door and neither are you, and if you try...
4	The psycho-vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder.
4	We've run into a fog system not previously reported.
4	I'm afraid of you?
4	It's too young for a heart attack.
4	Bob?
4	I smell blood.
4	No!
4	It's just that... the breeding is no longer working.
4	Carefully!
4	Love you, too.
4	Eddington said to tell the old man - I'm sorry, sir, the captain - that he'd better start thinking about a tow.
4	Cam, stop!
4	What am I gonna do?
4	The reason you never take your wallet out at a ball game or anyplace else is that someone's gonna steal it from you.
4	No!
4	Please don't spank me, Mr Healy.
4	Steady.
4	We're going to be killed!
4	I shall die on the gallows.
4	Let's get out of here!
4	The red blood lust! What else could it be?
4	Jeanne!
4	It could break us financially.
4	I'm in a strange man surrounded by strangers in a strange room!
4	These are some of the highest ranking military officials in our defense program.
4	That puts quite a burden on the company.
4	Shit...
4	What if he kills Nick?
4	Fucking cops!
4	I didn't mean to oversell.
4	Both those guys on the trailer are in it.
4	I'm just not certain it's the right thing.
4	Can we... can we not?
4	Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the money?
4	There's no stopping what can't be stopped.
4	If she succeeds, the consequences will be disastrous.
4	Are we in danger?
4	I really have no explanation for that, Senator.
4	Our soldiers are dying in the inferno to be burning tanks.
4	They cast me in a prison, and when they failed...
4	At some point, she told me about this guy who used to come around to check on her.
4	The brooding eyes...
4	No, let's not risk it. OK.
4	How do I undo the spell?
4	That is a very deep cut.
4	Looks like trouble for your boss.
4	Please, hurry, this man is really ill.
4	Keep your voice down.
4	We're all gonna die!
4	We're all gonna die!
4	Don't think for a minute That was an empty threat he made.
4	But it can't be a date" date."
4	They have a craving for human flesh.
4	Oh, boy.
4	He's killing me.
4	You came up here to kill me, didn't you?
4	Blowing them up.
4	So my father was murdered.
4	Let me talk to her. Let me just talk to her.
4	We'll do this thing together.
4	Show yourself, come on!
4	Maybe you can talk this over later in private, maybe.
4	We'll have to hope that that's enough.
4	It's difficult holding her.
4	Something seriously wrong with us.
4	Transmission's weak.
4	Yes, but when the cash runs out, they'll mob us.
4	He took six pills in one hour, instead of one every four hours.
4	Good heavens, is that thing lost again?
4	You been in touch with Brennan...
4	Just look at her. Look at the size of her.
4	Anything serious?
4	Removed?
4	It ain't safe to go that way...
4	It's a monster!
4	It's all been like a crazy nightmare.
4	Do we have to sit with them?
4	We're being wiped out!
4	Something terrible always happens when I go to a party.
4	Oh, God.
4	I'm trapped, Sydney.
4	I hope that while we're waiting, another disaster doesn't occur.
4	Back down! -All right, all right, all right.
4	Sure as hell is. He called us from there five minutes ago.
4	Please, I'm begging you.
4	It couldn't have been me, sir.
4	What are you spying on?
4	But then, uh.... You look to me like a gal with a big appetite for everything.
4	Self-defense.
4	Wish for our lives!
4	It was just... something happened that... hasn't happened in like  years.
4	He'd kill you if he heard you.
4	Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
4	Did they hit you, Pat?
4	Father, this could kill you. Yes. Yes, but that's irrelevant.
4	I worry about you, that's all.
4	So, we are going to file multiple lawsuits and mobilize the communities that have been touched by Backpage.
4	Queeg endangered the lives of the men.
4	Take me out. Help me!
4	Look, there's something weird going on here, and I can't quite follow it.
4	We'd just started boarding when this happened.
4	What happens to us now?
4	Be careful!
4	Something too frightful to utter.
4	Don't, I've got things in my mouth!
4	Wait... wait-wait,
4	We're running out of ammunition.
4	Living horrors of the deep were described today"
4	She figured out where the kids are being held, and she wants us to go rescue them.
4	Are you trying to get me killed?
4	We may have made a mistake.
4	Is it worth the risk of a scandal?
4	Even if we die?
4	Something's going to happen on Gavabutu soon.
4	That explains why they didn't rape me right off.
4	But I'm not sure anything else makes sense right now.
4	Just in case.
4	What then?
4	The police have road blocks on every main exit from town.
4	Come on! You're gonna break your guitar. Come on.
4	Break it up. Break it up.
4	He's not coming back.
4	Well, I figure I'm screwed, right?
4	Help!
4	What must have been painful and difficult questions for you... Considering your relationship to the defendant.
4	Captain...
4	Babette, no!
4	Not good.
4	Don't come apart on me now.
4	If you know where she is, I beg you to tell me now before it's too late.
4	Not a victim, Gibbs-- a target, like you.
4	We whispered your names when we were kids... scared to say them out loud.
4	Don't push. - What's wrong?
4	By the destruction of any nuclear weapons sent into space.
4	But it's our necks you're risking now, and I say no.
4	He wants to die!
4	But what happens if...
4	Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.
4	Stella, I don't know how to play this person, and I don't know who she is.
4	After this, I doubt we shall be allowed to live at all.
4	Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.
4	They're dead, but they're coming for us.
4	And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon.
4	She's hysterical, beating...
4	What are you trying to do to me?
4	Please, this job means everything to me.
4	But the rescue has to happen immediately.
4	Hello. - Never, ever pick up the phone.
4	Ben, are you all right?
4	But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did?
4	Nurse!
4	We're going to... -, get out of there!
4	Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child.
4	Take it off!
4	That storm is pretty bad.
4	Something's wrong here.
4	What the hell am I supposed to do now?
4	!
4	That ain't gonna last forever.
4	l swear on the Virgin, nobody knows!
4	You seem to me to be what my mother warned me about:
4	You look a little off-colour, Scotty.
4	Uh-oh uh-oh... Why did you take down the Lisbon Lace number?
4	They know that if that power was, you know, delineated to the average person, we wouldn't need them anymore.
4	What if Her Majesty should overhear you?
4	I fear that what life remains to me...
4	We've gotta get the kids!
4	But he knew I was lying.
4	These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain.
4	It's like that time in Tombstone when he made me walk... stripped down to only my long-handles and my hat.
4	She had a bit of an accident back there.
4	When he finds out our dam is at his boys camp he'll start asking questions.
4	I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again.
4	Please, give me one more minute!
4	Look, I take my medications. My problem isn't compliance.
4	Meaning what, that I have no money? -l don't know.
4	No one can feel safe living in a community... when there are reckless and irresponsible neurotics... wandering about its thoroughfares armed with deadly weapons.
4	This is just horrible.
4	But to speak of this, to anyone, would bring dire consequences.
4	That's all I need, five more minutes.
4	I can't trust nobody.
4	A strange voice, a set of instructions that might have come from anywhere.
4	Now she's going to Greenland to measure glacial melt. By herself.
4	Even if they got lost somewhere.
4	He also does not support me.
4	What about if they engage us?
4	What are you doing? - Shh.
4	Please. Please listen to me.
4	She's about eight months pregnant and, uh...
4	If we close, our stock won't be worth a nickel.
4	He's cutting our throat.
4	Watch it, folks!
4	When? - Call came in last night.
4	Slow down, we lost Ben!
4	The sea makes me seasick and I'm afraid of flying.
4	Just hear me out on this, OK? I've known you a long time.
4	What have I done now?
4	I should have taken my chances with the cannibals.
4	We'll never get to the airport.
4	Come out, come out wherever you are...
4	How dare you, you... How long has she been in this condition?
4	My little finger, it's all black and blue.
4	This has gone too far now, huh?
4	Life is more terrifying and more mysterious.
4	There was the explosion in Chile.
4	Whoops.
4	They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club... and they've been bonded by the steward.
4	What if you have to back to the castle?
4	Let us out!
4	To do that would cause worldwide panic.
4	Mike, I was so scared.
4	Do what he says:
4	Let's put this on your wrist. What is that? Ok, this is a digital heart monitor.
4	If I let go, I'll fall!
4	Do you think we're getting anywhere?
4	I feel some concern for his safety.
4	I see the monster.
4	* don't want to be re-re-re-repossessed * * re-re-re-repossessed
4	Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
4	We're gonna freeze to death.
4	She's vulnerable, wide-open to be hurt badly.
4	But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?
4	You do realize you're talking about going after an FBI agent?
4	So, you'll work your way through all the gangsters?
4	Which future has God, if there is a God, chosen for man's destiny?
4	Withdraw!
4	The cops found Glockisi Greg's trust.
4	Get off me!
4	Didn't I tell ya some day he'd turn on ya?
4	Stick your nose back in this county, and you'll never see daylight again.
4	Anyway, last year he comes to me. He wants some names checked out. Who was where, who's doing what.
4	Yeah, um, are we starting the interview now?
4	We've managed to keep it quiet, but if anyone knows, there'll be a SWAT team here.
4	Most of their wounds won't heal properly.
4	Who knows what it might do.
4	Get the fuck back!
4	Hawkins!
4	Ned, don't.
4	Look out!
4	Nothing wild, right?
4	I knew my ill-fitting clothes were unsuited to the exertions that lay before me.
4	Help him!
4	I don't expect nothing. I'm nonchalant.
4	What's wrong with my eyes?
4	You're gonna be on Syrian and Israeli radar the moment you take off.
4	Oh, hell!
4	It's not an easy thing to do.
4	And now we need a law enforcement unit able to meet the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough firepower to get the job done.
4	Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution...
4	It's only temporary, you know?
4	Man, they'd lock me up from now to Moses.
4	I've just heard a startling piece of news.
4	It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners.
4	We've always embraced the very things for which others have burned you at the stake.
4	You know, now that we're alone, there's... There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
4	Sort of, yes, from around the neighborhood.
4	If you want him to die, shoot now.
4	This looks like a mind-fuck to me.
4	Are you all right?
4	Did I do something wrong?
4	I was shot up pretty bad.
4	No, no! - Let's go. - It's supposed to be here!
4	Well, they went to the DA, which means they think you did.
4	I'm alarmed about you.
4	If anyone looks like they know you...
4	Are you sure it's him?
4	They'll get me tonight, for sure.
4	No-no-no-no... now, see, half of my team is dead... by your hand.
4	They'll kill us first.
4	To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.
4	My brother must've found the keys.
4	Oh, my God.
4	Come on, wake up.
4	He said that to scare us.
4	It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't-- He don't know why we're here.
4	I have to get out of here. or what's left of my family is going to die.
4	Look out!
4	Besides I can't-- l can't afford to lose  bucks.
4	You know, Melanie, I've just remembered I've got quite a lot of work to do tonight, so I think I'll be going.
4	I should have taken my chances with the cannibals.
4	Japs!
4	You know, you-you could get hurt. You shouldn't go around robbing people. You could go to jail.
4	It can only blow up in our faces.
4	Guns for them?
4	There's a face beneath this face. - No!
4	Looks like trouble ahead.
4	The director is not the problem. It's the insurance company. They won't cover you if you do drugs.
4	As bad as it was having her missing, it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your -year-old child.
4	The most terrifying ever beheld by human eyes.
4	Tears ain't gonna help you now!
4	I'm sorry.
4	Look out!
4	Not good. Let's not get caught in the car.
4	That Englishman wants a fight?
4	If we quit, some Federal judge take away your money.
4	It is being covered up, but, probably not for the reasons you might think.
4	God keep us, keep us all.
4	We weren't trying to escape.
4	I just don't want it to happen to my sisters, or your kids, or the next kid.
4	It all began one night when the lights went out.,
4	There's no doctors upstairs, and there's no way out of here.
4	It's three years since my last confession.
4	But, you see, if this thing here controls you, it's gonna burn you and everythin' else around you up. That's right.
4	That's terrible!
4	I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. You're in danger.
4	They really do know where I'm hiding, Geoffrey?
4	Well, that's a dangerous thing to do.
4	We're losing the wind!
4	I'm going now to the church for confession.
4	He was trying to stop it.
4	You'll get killed just to give something away.
4	Bomb!
4	Leon!
4	I've just been bitten by a snake.
4	Excuse me your highnesses, but you're going to be late, And this restaurant recipe begs to order.
4	Do them all. I may never get back on.
4	No!
4	Right now I am just freaking out.
4	Where are you taking me?
4	Another $? - That was from way before.
4	He's got a shotgun on you, Wade.
4	Keep your head down, hotshot!
4	Would they mock him?
4	And I felt real scared, Savannah.
4	Listen, I really can't talk about this over the phone.
4	It's serious trouble. So many dead and wounded.
4	Oh, this is terrible.
4	We just found out they were lost!
4	These two shooters you just brought up from Miami.
4	We didn't pass that cutoff, did we?
4	Yes, I confess.
4	You can't do this to him, or to all the others.
4	Eben's crying! Eben's crying!
4	Get the hell up because I'm out here alone.
4	C'mon, rest awhile girl.
4	I haven't done anything wrong.
4	The columns and the wolves were after me night and day.
4	He blows it.
4	You know, you're gonna get yourself killed.
4	It's gonna be a massacre.
4	They were looking at me.
4	Whenever I'm petrified, I either cry or sing.
4	To read something like that was, frankly, it was alarming to me.
4	Might be it needs dragging up.
4	Let me in!
4	Come on, hurry! Hurry!
4	What about staying alive!
4	I'll die if they send me to prison.
4	They're looking for us, all right.
4	God, I'll lose him.
4	You're scaring me.
4	So help me God.
4	Give the old man a drink.
4	Get a doctor at once!
4	And then he'll run our lives and take our money.
4	If we don't get that money, how's Wheaton gonna go to seattle?
4	I'll get some help!
4	Rocky, mind if I talk to you outside about a few things?
4	No! No! No!
4	Lighten ship and drop all ballasts. Get below!
4	Why ain't my mother here?
4	Help me, please! - Get him off me!
4	Okay? - We're not dead yet?
4	I really have no explanation for that, Senator.
4	He could shoot you and say you tried to run.
4	Oh, God.
4	What are you, my mother?
4	To have an ugly incident occur while we're on this train with no method of escape that is not in our self-interest, either.
4	You've exceeded everyone's expectations, the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...
4	You should... -What?
4	They certainly want you to stay on. It's just, they felt when it came to head of department...
4	I know you are, but this just got  times harder for me to get out of.
4	Since he found out we're behind it, he's been running us ragged.
4	Oh, God, no. Oh, no.
4	Get it through your head, or you and me are both gone too.
4	Perhaps I have become, as you put it, obsessed by our name and our past, and the absence of our future, and by our paintings.
4	I'm a frightened tramp.
4	Stop calling me, please.
4	Bring him to me!
4	Twenty-four, maybe even twenty-five years.
4	There'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed.
4	Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.
4	Are they all shark victims?
4	Well, I don't know whether I can believe all this.
4	Please... No...
4	Who appear to be inconvenient, or troublesome through knowing too much.
4	Please I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife.
4	But I can't volunteer anything.
4	Some days I wake up--
4	And there she was, dead.
4	He was gonna die?
4	Oh, no.
4	I don't like this.
4	When I find Phyllis...
4	X-Ray, this is Bad Karma.
4	Are you sure you really love me?
4	Y'all take care now, you hear?
4	Get off me! Get off me!
4	But they're all dead.
4	But there's something you may not know about us.
4	Still a lot of soldiers around Better get inside
4	Anyway, um, I might need some help translating that.
4	That might not be the worst of it.
4	Yeah, yeah, I'm aware of the regulations.
4	We've really gotta make tracks or we're dead! C'mon!
4	No!
4	I've, uh, really enjoyed this little chat.
4	Mr Blair, sir?
4	Look, I ain't no snitch, but the reason me and Jake don't speak no more is because I told him he went too far with that.
4	Yeah, I um, I just... just thought I saw something, but I can't really, um, trust my eyes these days.
4	Who was killed?
4	Tell everybody what I think about them?
4	I wouldn't trust anybody.
4	They ended up deciding that, you know, I could go ahead and do the oral argument.
4	Sent what?
4	Christ. I don't know what you've been up to, but Garcia is pissing fire.
4	You're gonna make me swear on the Bible?
4	I'd be too scared to do it.
4	He ain't gonna make it.
4	Why do you want to kill all my friends?
4	Never forget that Satan constantly surrounds us, With but one goal in mind...
4	Charlie, please don't go.
4	The beast is at the gates!
4	I'm not surprised. Me, too.
4	Look out!
4	Now he's found me.
4	Look, in what I do, there are sometimes pressures.
4	Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.
4	I might not be around for much longer.
4	Go on! Go back and get the knife!
4	Dude, there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
4	I guess.
4	Did Captain Queeg look sick?
4	You'll kill him, stop!
4	Shit, you scared me!
4	What's going on, Vinnie?
4	Boom.
4	They're quite merciless.
4	Perhaps he killed Elefante, too.
4	Goddamn it.
4	Put your heads down. Put your fucking heads down!
4	What's wrong with my eyes?
4	No!
4	You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
4	Maybe they heard something.
4	But the neighbours will know we've adopted.
4	Oh, I hope it's not serious.
4	The girl escaped... the other one and my son are looking for her.
4	Don't you find that kind of disturbing?
4	Finish her!
4	Jesus Christ!
4	You have destroyed us.
4	No, it isn't. Just because we aren't expecting resistance, don't relax on this one.
4	What you have to ask is whether you will be able to resist him.
4	A river patrol just fished a girl out of the water.
4	The sunsets were pink...
4	She went in there to find the Hope Diamond. Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.
4	No, no, no, no, no.
4	Spoil what?
4	I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan.
4	And if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900,men out of work.
4	If you're guides there, I'll kill your family.
4	Can you do me a favor and tell mom I'm okay And I'm not coming home.
4	How can we be absolutely sure the waste disposal is taken care of?
4	Oh, he's hurt!
4	You'll go too far.
4	This means Siberia, for sure.
4	Are you buried alive? No.
4	Did I get home all right last night?
4	I was so worried that...
4	That bridge would collapse under the first train.
4	Go!
4	Mr President, what happens to me in the morning?
4	Well, this may not be the best time to bring it up, but a  call just came in.
4	Leslie would not like it.
4	Are you sure it's him?
4	To be hypnotized indirectly is very common, but to be regressed indirectly is not only unusual but a little nerve-wracking.
4	Stop!
4	Otherwise you'll never get out of Mexico alive.
4	Now, that was probably a mistake because now you're in danger anyway.
4	We may have another shark problem.
4	My career will be ruined.
4	Ri... Riley, listen to me, he'll kill you. Please!
4	Come on, we gotta warn him.
4	It's not safe.
4	He who wears the ring... ♪ Help!
4	Nearly creamed us both.
4	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle, what is it?
4	Dad!
4	Ask him how we'll get outta here.
4	No unpleasantness, I hope.
4	There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here. My life is in danger. Three ten.
4	It's like they're after me, right?
4	Okay, we need to locate Oliver's father immediately.
4	Please save us.
4	You got my respect and silence, Alberto, okay?
4	Here, faster, before the planes are back.
4	Jeanne ... Majesty.
4	This is my first night being a dad.
4	Now is as good a time as any to learn.
4	It's a matter of life and death.
4	I think I'm gonna faint.
4	It's already on the : news.
4	Oh, dear me.
4	There's no one left to fly the plane.
4	The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.
4	Run!
4	Christ, he's been stripped.
4	It's looking for us.
4	If he starts convincing those senators, you might as well blow your brains out!
4	I have a terrible feeling he cut off my head.
4	What would she do?
4	That's a stolen car.
4	Mommy, what happened to your hand?
4	No, he's different! Please, Father, for me!
4	I didn't know what I was doing.
4	WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?
4	Look what's in the street.
4	Not right away! That wouldn't be fair.
4	I always knew there was something strange about their crowd. What are you talking about?
4	Please, Johnny.
4	Father, I've led such a sinful life.
4	How about my wrist?
4	I'm not certain there's a limit to what she'll do.
4	Look, sir, we haven't much time.
4	They say he killed a man when he was 12,years old.
4	My wife went to a lot of trouble.
4	Okay, I'm sorry, all right?
4	Of course, but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him.
4	Nick killed Juliette?
4	We whispered your names when we were kids... scared to say them out loud.
4	Be warned. she usually means exactly what she says.
4	I think that we're lost.
4	Do something.
4	The monster?
4	Mayday!
4	I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100,to one.
4	You're supposed to say something.
4	What do I do, Bloomy?
4	They don't tell you why.
4	She killed her husband same as if she shot him.
4	Are you OK?
4	They said I was photographing a military subject.
4	They're coming here... to Portland.
4	Wait! Wait right here!
4	If I miss that meeting, I'll lose about half next year's sales commissions.
4	Do something!
4	The devil is always waiting in the shadows.""
4	What? They took her body.
4	He went after him like...
4	We should go.
4	I-I'm in here.
4	I ... just afraid to lose you.
4	I killed her! I killed her like she was an animal.
4	The dead are being reactivated by forces unknown.
4	What was that?""
4	Anyone in your vicinity is in danger.
4	Don't you understand?
4	The devil himself!
4	I've no other place to go.
4	We're playing with fire.
4	He's crazier than I am.
4	You're right. I don't have to come, but I wanna tell you something.
4	Where the fuck is he? Arnie!
4	Another big guy, he pulls his badge, and he says:
4	Martha, I-I-I love you.
4	Are you okay?
4	He's hurt pretty bad.
4	Kill that cat, Kid.
4	Wouldn't you say that prison is my fate?
4	Then they killed Nicky Capelli. One behind the ear with a ..
4	Please, be careful.
4	Oh, wait!
4	They might take us for innocent bystanders.
4	We know next to nothing about them except we believe they're connected to the Hezbollah.
4	That's dangerous.
4	And now the kidnappers are playing them against each other, trying to get the $ million.
4	That to marry Maria would be the most senselessly cruel and destructive thing you will ever have done?
4	It's over.
4	Liz, be careful!
4	Paulie, are you OK?
4	Satan's spirit flew right out of my TV set And into my soul.
4	I'm not fit to be a senator!
4	Watch your back.
4	Since he escaped, residents of the bordering states have been afraid to leave their home.
4	Yes, sir.
4	You can't tell anybody.
4	Mommy, I saw a ghost.
4	He's dead, isn't he?
4	They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.
4	Dear, a mere child.
4	They're armed.
4	Maybe we've missed him already.
4	We've got to get this man off the floor.
4	I'm peeing my pants.
4	They hurt you any, Maxwell?
4	Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore.
4	It's too risky.
4	When I left her she was alive!
4	No, no pictures.
4	Oh, no?
4	If things don't work out...
4	They'll destroy you.
4	If I go, you'll ruin me.
4	Perhaps this was the one step too far.
4	Well, the Kid hit him once, and he ain't come back yet.
4	Something's wrong.
4	Now, be careful, children.
4	What's wrong?
4	You made a mistake I'm not Bing Chow!
4	Now where the hell am I?
4	They look like giants.
4	But how will your father feel if he never sees you again?
4	Hurry!
4	With all the contributions of the Sea Hawks... we cannot possibly match Phillip's vast resources.
4	The cops are all over the place.
4	Or am I going mad?
4	I don't know what the hell to do.
4	I just can't keep doing this.
4	Officer, please, for God's sake, they're looting the Food King!
4	You're in great danger.
4	How do you know?
4	Please, he'll crush them into wine, honey.
4	Or we have a problem with the judges.
4	It's gonna be a treacherous hike.
4	Uh, six reported injured, two are in sick bay, two more seriously being rushed to Norfolk Memorial.
4	But until we figure it out, it may be a good idea for you to stay at home.
4	Good luck.
4	I couldn't...
4	He begged Siegfried to let him live and offered him his lance.""
4	I'll do that. Uh... I'll go find him and I'll just ask him where car  really is.
4	They're maniacs.
4	You don't know from one day to the next... whether you're going to be killed, go home, or get busted.
4	Repeat,  destroyers.
4	God, we got a single shooter, southeast tower.
4	Your Honor, isn't that a question for the jury?
4	Watch it, it's still wet.
4	So I hit the casino floor, I'm walking out, heart's in my mouth.
4	Who is there?
4	Just wait till he's looking down your throat, that's all.
4	Killed the pain all right, but he almost died.
4	I don't know about you guys... but I gotta get outta here.
4	Chappie, you said that if Brennan came up dirty, you won't take him in.
4	Help. Help me.
4	Meanwhile, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank.
4	Really scary.
4	You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
4	You're not going to leave your friend, sir... are you?
4	I don't want to get shot.
4	Don't tell Lara this.
4	When he finds out our dam is at his boys camp he'll start asking questions.
4	Stop. Stop.
4	There's plenty of Nuke to go around.
4	We could have been killed.
4	They all point to me.
4	The doctor said you shouldn't excite yourself.
4	Well if you don't see it, we ain't got it.
4	And that scares the shit out of me, kid.
4	We gotta let him out!
4	I can tell you now I was a little worried when I heard you weren't going to be here yourself.
4	Dad, don't let them take me.
4	Why do you look at me like that?
4	You're running the risk of harming your children.
4	I do not know who he brings.
4	There's speculation that he's already...
4	They're not to come here, you understand?
4	Car exploded outside.
4	Call me, okay?
4	Holy shit!
4	You injured your knee in a game.
4	You ain't really gonna let them take that baby, are you?
4	There's one thing you oughta know, professor...
4	Just throw our hats in the air.
4	We can't let you out of here. You know that. Of course.
4	Brave?
4	Is he all right?
4	There is no other way out, my friend.
4	I knew someone would get killed, but nobody listened.
4	We went to the very heart of the vessel... The propulsion unit.
4	Help me!
4	Hey, I'm sorry about upstairs but I do see your pretty face and I just had to kiss it.
4	We've to get out of here and get help!
4	They're vicious killers! Wait a minute!
4	What about the Berserkers?
4	Don't look right or left.
4	Oh, no.
4	You try to escape...
4	This fucking guy's scaring me.
4	Doctor, how long has this stuff been going on?
4	I don't think you'll be able to stand it long.
4	They were never there, this never happened.
4	Barb, what's the matter?
4	It's not enough.
4	Get me out of here!
4	He's cutting our throat.
4	Not covet thy neighbor's wife.
4	It's too late to start anything now.
4	By the way ...
4	That's gonna be hard.
4	This wasn't supposed to happen.
4	Keep it down, you'll wake the munchkins!
4	We mustn't stop.
4	He'll kill me if he has to.
4	I'm in an awful hurry.
4	Wait!
4	How is she?
4	Do you think we can get away with squirrel?
4	Oh, Jesus! God!
4	How do you know we can trust her? She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
4	Trubel, run!
4	I'm just so scared.
4	I'm worried about the future, and what people will think.
4	And it starts creating the specter of a threat.
4	Can you make it?
4	How can you want me now I'm like this?
4	We're not going to risk a massive lawsuit.
4	There's no time!
4	Did I get home all right last night?
4	Don't look!
4	Let him go.
4	Out in the country that, uh...
4	They're burying' us alive!
4	Cause we just got a package, and I don't see his address here in the...
4	Come on!
4	It's not what you think. I-I-I would never... Please, Michael.
4	It's too late, isn't it?
4	I don't know why I'm in such a hurry to get into trouble again.
4	Dad? Dad...?
4	Don't anybody move!
4	No, the flight must be stopped.
4	The country agencies are in desperate need of these funds.
4	Help me.
4	We lost Ben!
4	We haven't enough fuel to hold the keel down.
4	Despite our power the few of us would be busy indefinitely trying to suppress a large, hostile population.
4	Just promise me you'll see a doctor as soon as you get there, okay?
4	Two against one?
4	This is most evil of all.
4	Beth, you're making me very nervous.
4	I'll never be able to match that.
4	He'll get you into more trouble.
4	Um, uh, push three?
4	Yikes! A penguin in a pot!
4	How did Donna injure Liberty Rail?
4	This girl appears from nowhere. Now she's talking to this guy. That's a little convenient, don't you think?
4	I'd have to kill myself.
4	I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind.
4	Stop the car!
4	He got wounded somewhere in Tennessee, and they sent him home.
4	The general talked about killing the president.
4	Do not leave fingerprints!
4	You know what would happen if Chet found out?
4	I'll get you now!
4	I had made the first real enemy of my life.
4	I mean, after my exorcism, I-I've strived to lead A good, clean, decent life.
4	What's the matter?
4	There's nothing wrong with that I hope, sister?
4	Do something!
4	You can't.
4	Oh, my God.
4	David, where are you?
4	I want to go.
4	He can raise public opinion against us.
4	It's ticking like a bomb.
4	Was he hurt bad?
4	We're so damn lost.
4	Where's my mommy?
4	I'll ask you straight.
4	You're sure we're not, uh, crowding you, eh?
4	You aren't one of them, are you?
4	Well, we won't tell anybody about that, okay?
4	What's the matter, Maria?
4	King Willie, voodoo priest of the LA posses.
4	I'm going home. I-I'm not well.
4	The whole town in panic.
4	They'll rip off your head and shit down your neck!
4	The Montauk Club, : pm.
4	I lost my virginity and was raped, and I...
4	We got to save her!
4	We should leave before it's too late.
4	The French Navy knows everything.
4	He let go of my hand. And I was lost.
4	Don't shoot!
4	What are you doing here?
4	Rock, go!
4	Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
4	It'll only get you in trouble.
4	Hurry back.
4	You did worry me.
4	Don't do it haphazardly This spell is hard to reverse
4	When Janet came back she was dead.
4	If you print anything now, I'll be exposed.
4	I parked it in... in a parking lot and I just... I forgot where I parked it.
4	You'll land us all in prison.
4	Lightning can kill you.
4	But my problem is, there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police.
4	He wants to die!
4	You know, it's dangerous for you to be here in the frozen food section.
4	It's something I couldn't discuss with anyone.
4	They can't fire both of us, right?
4	Come on!
4	They took the one with the collar?
4	I...
4	It's not right to leave it in there.
4	It's not like that.
4	Captain, we're in serious trouble.
4	What should I be afraid?
4	It's black smoke.
4	I'm not getting any younger!
4	We've lost you.
4	David, are you okay?
4	Hurry!
4	All: Ohh, shit.
4	I don't want her hurt at all.
4	Captain, back the starboard engine!
4	These are the firearms we use.
4	Getting raped on a daily basis by upwards of  adults a day, having at these seventh grade kids any way they want.
4	You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?
4	Junior's gonna be a convict before he's in third grade!
4	It's too late.
4	Now let's move, but let's take the back door.
4	Mike, it's impossible!
4	We are at war. We have all to do what we will be able.
4	( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind?
4	Oh no. Shit! Pettine!
4	Now, because I screwed up, read from that book, one lousy time, evil has found me.
4	Lacy, watch out!
4	Once at sea, if we get there, our troubles will have just begun.
4	You make me feel uncomfortable.
4	They murder everything that moves.
4	Collision speed! Full!
4	These guys, they don't do it for money. -What? -They don't do it for money.
4	With this strike they've no way home, and there's not a room in the city.
4	Myself. When I am in possession of my faculties and Queeg is not.
4	It's you.
4	They'll kill you and all of us.
4	I wouldn't dare answer that.
4	Stay here.
4	He brought in his own detective to replace Harold Greer.
4	Why don't we see if we can find a nice place for her.
4	Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?
4	It's her!
4	Go! Out of here!
4	How much time has the world got?
4	Rocky's been hit with bombs.
4	He's the fox in the henhouse!
4	I didn't know what to do.
4	It's not going to be a problem, is it, Tess?
4	Yes. -Well, this is an emergency!
4	We're prisoners of war.
4	All killed?
4	What'd she take? -Pills.
4	I'll hide you somewhere.
4	God took them because of my wicked thoughts! No.
4	I didn't want to mess it up.
4	You've got me worried, dear.
4	It means, um... if you say anything about this, - your ass is grass. - Okay.
4	Here he comes.
4	I don't know, maybe we're all just spooked.
4	I'm alarmed about you.
4	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
4	There are many problems attendant to running such a large territory.
4	I have risen to a difficult task.
4	I got enough problems with my old man.
4	I've been robbed.
4	No, you don't!
4	I've been doing just that for years, until Sergei walked into my shop last week.
4	Please, stop doing things.
4	Come closer.
4	Those people have a tough time.
4	Ivo, I warn you.
4	Father, he might betray you!
4	I just want it in a flaky pastry.
4	Dad, they've got Johnny.
4	He shot himself.
4	Father, is it all over?
4	You know how much money you're gonna lose in a strike?
4	Without a wind, we'll lose him!
4	Nuclear peace for  years.
4	When the shooting starts, don't forget to duck.
4	Hank, I need to talk to you about a  call that just came in.
4	He calls back, and this time he's very frightened.
4	I'm going to Martinique with a million bucks taped to my butt unless you keep screwing around, in which case, we'll all go to jail.
4	What's dying?
4	Even if you get past me, there are  cops waiting outside.
4	They saw everything.
4	A cop having a nervous breakdown might have shot two drug dealers. They might have.
4	Set us free!
4	You're gonna need weapons, all of you.
4	I'd like to know why I'm being shot.
4	Excuse me...
4	I think they're gonna kill you with the press too.
4	Never, not even for a minute, I believed that you had been.
4	Am I really good enough?
4	We take this, they'll booger us forever!
4	I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
4	We gotta do something!
4	We've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity.
4	You know, ten Colombians and Scorpios armed to fuck all.
4	I see them coming, baby I'm throwing myself in the fucking ocean!
4	What about us?
4	What about the witnesses?
4	You were right.
4	You're gonna find out.
4	It's a shark!
4	Don't misunderstand me.
4	Fire!
4	You've got to manage without the doctor.
4	That's not true.
4	Careful, brother.
4	He'll snap any day.
4	They took her.
4	I worked for you.
4	Come on, son. Come on.
4	We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments.
4	That's two accidents in a week.
4	You know, Pran is not gonna last five minutes out there.
4	Oh, o dear...
4	I'm.. I no m..mean to.
4	How come there is no fire in the room?
4	His body and clothes soaked in blood?
4	He's ready for a fall.
4	I really have. - I-I-I must go now.
4	Did I go too far?
4	I was the opposite. I was angry.
4	Run, Ringo!
4	I want you to be on fucking guard, man.
4	No, stay there. You must stay.
4	If Barbara sees a phone company subpoena, now, she'll bust a gut.
4	What the hell are we doing out here?
4	Evil spirits pervade this road
4	He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.
4	Because this could be a threat to all life on Earth if we are reckless with this issue.
4	What am I gonna do?
4	She can't stay off that kidney machine too long.
4	LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED, UNDRESS, SHOWER, BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED
4	Now, Vin, remember, no speeding! Watch yourself.
4	The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims, which could present a hostage situation.
4	It must be serious.
4	I... I can't.
4	I can't go through it... You hear me?
4	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers, so it's hurting.
4	I-I am working on it, and I will figure it out.
4	Gonna die!
4	Their screams... you never forget something like that.
4	He'll keep us flying missions till we're all dead.
4	I'm afraid so.
4	How about the gardener? This evidence might convict me in court.
4	Um, they're in the, uh, cabinet.
4	Let's just worry about getting out of here.
4	Hey, don't shoot!
4	I'm telling you, sir, you've got to put a stop to him now.
4	Please stop!
4	He has to testify again in New York in  days, but he not gonna make it now because by tomorrow this story's in the newspaper.
4	If we screw up graduation, we'll have to take basics all over again.
4	You come to a crime scene, you don't know who to shoot.
4	Heavens, no!
4	It's a big mistake.
4	He can raise public opinion against us.
4	McGann's out of his mind.
4	I don't know what you're talking about.
4	I see. So what do we do now?
4	In the meantime, I'll be dead.
4	It's too dangerous, it's utterly unpredictable.
4	I'll be late for the first bell!
4	You're the kind of person that gets innocent bystanders killed.
4	If you do that you'll get nothing, except maybe the police after you.
4	Please be careful.
4	You'd rather be found dead with two small children in Ohio?
4	l don't want to hurt a cop.
4	You really are trying to kill me, aren't you?
4	Is there no a door of another side?
4	There must be an error.
4	for the next war will be an interplanetary war."
4	What is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match what's out there?
4	I am aware of that, but to be seen together could be disastrous for us both.
4	If we yield to blackmail from this man, we'll become a laughing stock!
4	I've only got  hours.
4	They'd never approve of that being released.
4	Where were you?
4	What was that crack?
4	This isn't going to be as easy to get out of.
4	I can't breathe!
4	Stop the presses!
4	Can I count on you?
4	Your boy is sicker than we know.
4	Can't be good for the image.
4	We don't know what we're dealing with.
4	To tell the truth, Baron, tonight we're a little bit nervous.
4	Well, uh, actually I'm just having coffee. I'm not having breakfast or anything.
4	It's a trap.
4	Don't you know me?
4	If it wouldn't be too much trouble.
4	I hope they haven't spotted us.
4	Hope that some help comes.
4	How the hell are you going to give it to me in public?
4	Is anyone down there?
4	But this is a family emergency, we do need you at home,
4	If I'm not on guard every moment, you steal across the border into reality.
4	He's inside!
4	You're hopelessly outnumbered
4	I haven't even told my wife yet. You haven't?
4	Hurry!
4	They're coming to kill you!
4	It's going to be a disaster.
4	They'll kill you.
4	I hear you, Ned.
4	You start trouble, and I start bleeding.
4	You scared me.
4	Nurse...
4	You okay?
4	Do you know, for a second you had me worried?
4	If we push this, who are we pushing against?
4	Oh, the storm's coming.
4	I am afraid that there is no coincidence here.
4	How do you keep something secret?
4	You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes?
4	I don't know about that.
4	I won't go schizo, will I?
4	I see my child... in different poses... that look like she was drugged.
4	How long has she been gone? ! How long?
4	I'm sorry.
4	Help! - Hello...
4	Don't you have any idea where you're going?
4	I'm afraid he's been stalling.
4	They're coming!
4	Miss Windy, the villa has been ransacked
4	I just feel like if I don't do what you want you're gonna leave me.
4	I thought he'd kill me.
4	One, that I don't mess up as a manager.
4	We need to find both of them before they try to pay that ransom.
4	His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people.
4	I promise.
4	Almighty Sir... do not drop us in the claws of the eternal death...
4	Isn't it possible that some sort of external intelligence, some discarnate entity, has crossed into our plane of existence?
4	I do not know what to do.
4	And you're gonna ask me questions.
4	We got a big problem.
4	Relax.
4	That means we're in grave trouble.
4	I unfortunately have to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very effective.
4	You're not going to work with these monsters?
4	It'll probably kill me, too.
4	There's some problems.
4	What if Case tortures her?
4	Let me in!
4	I warned you!
4	Why do the Chinese care so much about what's on this Russian boat?
4	I'm a little bit frightened.
4	If the strychnine was not in the coffee and we know that it was not in the cocoa, where it was?
4	We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange.
4	Oh, God, we thought they'd killed you.
4	We gotta let him out!
4	I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.
4	Which way is this train heading?
4	There's got to be guns in this house.
4	Who's dead?
4	* Uh-oh uh-oh... Why did you take down the Lisbon Lace number?
4	He did that night.
4	Is Juliette really dead?
4	Is it, perhaps, that this cause is too hopeless?
4	What are we gonna do?
4	Emergency speed, all engines!
4	You see murder! You see guts!
4	I hope every member of this body feels as I do.
4	Not so bad, but there's dirty weather ahead.
4	Um, look, can we just forget last night?
4	What horror!
4	It was an accident.
4	Careful of my vitals.
4	Who are you and what do you want?
4	I took some funds from the con-amalgate account, I... To cover a loan. I...
4	I don't think you understand the situation. These guys are religious zealots.
4	No!
4	She tried to kill me because I told her about Nately.
4	You just be quiet. Be a nice girl.
4	I was nearly arrested here three years ago.
4	Help us.
4	Don't be long. You'll catch a cold.
4	Terror tactics, man.
4	No!
4	The coach was robbed and Bill Moons killed.
4	I was threatened.
4	They've got Johnny.
4	Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
4	I'm shocked.
4	Yeah, I'm aware of that. And they have all of them.
4	I'm not ready for this.
4	I hope I'm not obscure.
4	I might get bit, after all.
4	When you get hurt, yell.
4	It's a matter of life and death.
4	Ugh! Shocking!
4	Stella, could I have a word with you?
4	Let's get outta here!
4	How is that going to look at home?
4	Give us water!
4	I had  fights... ..and every one of 'em I was scared, so yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.
4	Fucking hell, man!
4	His plane could be late!
4	You get beaten though, don't you?
4	There's no way to make this easy, Mrs McConnel.
4	Let it be anybody but her.
4	They're looking all over for you.
4	Why is he so against your testifying?
4	Will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said?
4	It hurts!
4	These are strange times, my friend.
4	The captain left a sinking ship.
4	Once at sea, if we get there, our troubles will have just begun.
4	He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you.
4	It was a nightmare.
4	We're all gonna die.
4	He's one of the twins and not what you call completely there.""
4	Don't touch him, he's hot!
4	I can suggest something ...?
4	I've been robbed.
4	Don't be angry.
4	I can't breathe in here.
4	Oh, well I'm no psychiatrist.... She looks to me like she needs professional help.
4	We were a bit worried about you.
4	Cathy, what's the most recent communication we've received?
4	Doggone, I know there's something wrong!
4	It was an accident.
4	I think my dog's escaping.
4	What's up? What happened?
4	Something's going on.
4	They'll never believe us.
4	Get out while we're still ahead and alive.
4	He tried to knife me.
4	True, but the soldiers would kill us before we got to the river.
4	When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
4	Where's my mom?
4	You better come back.
4	I wasn't there when he died.
4	Larry, are we going to make it to the island?
4	Anyway, I practically had to beg her to take plastic, and you know how backed up that is.
4	What'll we do?
4	It's a passion that continues to grow, ... The more the King is drowning.
4	It's all been like a crazy nightmare.
4	Died thinking it might be over between us.
4	We're getting a lot of heat from parents' groups.
4	Oh, God.
4	I'm trapped.
4	I hope that's not what I'm hearing.
4	Sink that longboat!
4	Oh, shit.
4	What are you talking about, dad,
4	Oh, good gracious.
4	He'd punch on my mother, too.
4	I wouldn't trust anybody.
4	Wait till somebody gets killed?
4	I'm not doing it alone.
4	Father. I'm seeing a pattern here.
4	If they track you down, it wouldn't be our doing.
4	The epidermal what? No!
4	Tommy-boy's got a little something personal to discuss with you.
4	I'm burning.
4	Harvey, the lawsuit's dead. We don't have a plaintiff.
4	Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.
4	You're the lion.
4	Somebody help me!
4	Oh god, I promise I won't say anything.
4	Are you trying to kill me?
4	There's a big hole in the flight deck.
4	Let me out! Right!
4	You're getting heavier and heavier Can't carry you much longer
4	You sound sort of peculiar.
4	Let's hurry up and bury this bastard. I'm fucking knackered.
4	They'll shit down their pants and run like rabbits.
4	She was nothing... nothing human.
4	Uh, b-bullets for some, and f-fire for others.
4	I wouldn't dream of using such a tool.
4	They're coming!
4	What shall I do now?
4	Fracture that whole part of the world, and now we have ISIS.
4	When that bomb blows, we'll lose our oxygen fast.
4	You'll report to SIOC with Jane every morning to continue your mandatory sessions with me.
4	We got to do something or it'll be too late.
4	Joanna, sic him!
4	There are men in the house with guns.
4	I'm the one that left you that note today. That's so strange.
4	But people just respected him, respected his, uh...
4	Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
4	Why go on taking chances?
4	If we lose, get out of town quick.
4	It's too late, isn't it?
4	I don't like this, any of it.
4	For God's sakes, be careful out there!
4	She's gonna kill him, Eben.
4	What life awaits a half man outside the fence?
4	Stop, Jeff, stop!
4	Excuse me, but we've got a flight that's just about to leave.
4	Now, you must fly out immediately!
4	They behead people at noon
4	There's a man down there on his head.
4	They're going to nail us, no matter what we do.
4	Uh, I'm father mayii. I called...
4	I'm so scared my bones are clicking, like dice on a Reno crap table.
4	Trouble.
4	Trouble is that the Kid might be nervous, big game like this.
4	She's more frightened than anything.
4	What are you trying to do to me?
4	TV... Satan's spirit flew out of the TV!
4	Come clean right now. Uh...
4	Well, might as well make myself useful.
4	Edie, they'll kill you too.
4	Benny, look out for the Red Car!
4	You do not understand.
4	Oh, God.
4	Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you... Any reservations about Harold Greer's abilities?
4	How can I undo the spell?
4	I want to get out of there right now.
4	Suppose they meet?
4	What do you expect of me?
4	We are finished.
4	We have a complication.
4	Madam President, people will die.
4	What if I can't take it off?
4	They must have been tracking her or waiting for her to show up.
4	I fear the wrath of God.
4	Let me go!
4	It's like that time in Tombstone when he made me walk... stripped down to only my long-handles and my hat.
4	She plans her suicide.
4	Or God knows in how many lifetimes you'll be paying for it.
4	She's gone.
4	I don't want to die!
4	I heard he was connected with the government during the war, a spy.
4	He doesn't think the forensic chemist will be able to ID the spermicide.
4	I was worried about you.
4	I'm in fear of my life, you know.
4	So you can see Charles is deep in trouble.
4	Meanwhile, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank.
4	Why me?
4	In  hours every hit man in America will be here. I seriously doubt that.
4	I cannot believe I am forced to defend myself once again for the actions of a criminal.
4	It felt like an earthquake.
4	What are you going to do?
4	I just...
4	Brennan's gonna kill me, Bobby.
4	The whole team is working on it, all right, and we will find her.
4	Help!
4	Mike, I'm just trying to help you.
4	What have I done?
4	Why did you turn away from me?
4	Oh, my God. It's the devil.
4	You're jealous that I have Auryn, and you've come to take it from me.
4	Wait, wait, I can't do it from here.
4	Some gang of cutthroats and murderers.
4	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
4	Ooh... Well, we almost had it there for a second,
4	I really am in a hurry.
4	My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
4	Help me...
4	( isaac crying ) - it's cranky time.
4	Anna, most can barely walk.
4	You've got to get there before sundown.
4	The three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.""
4	We got to do something or it'll be too late.
4	We didn't hear that.
4	You're not gonna give him a chance, are you?
4	I didn't mean to kill him.
4	I can see panicked citizens taking to the streets if this gets out.
4	Then you'll get rid of me.
4	All that noise and fire...
4	I was afraid Hans Bergmann might have stolen the suitcase.
4	We must get everyone in Fantasia to help us.
4	There's something wrong with us, something very, very wrong with us.
4	There isn't anybody I can call for help.
4	This is the captain speaking.
4	We're in trouble now.
4	You give me no choice but to ground you.
4	Watch yourself. Kuwaiti Star, stand by. We're coming in on your port side.
4	Not to come to America, at least not for a while.
4	Who's that?
4	It could have been a dead end.
4	But they're all dead.
4	Well... L-l-listen! Don't say anything to Larner about this, all right?
4	Besides..., I don't want us to get too involved.
4	Is Mommy going to be all right?
4	What are you doing here?
4	I know. I don't want to say. I know how upset you'll be. I know how upset I was.
4	They can't do this to me.
4	I hope it doesn't get any worse.
4	Not the gondola, not the gondola.
4	Now, just a minute, gentlemen.
4	If we close, our stock won't be worth a nickel.
4	Be careful.
4	If we let him live, could he forgive us?
4	Don't burn yourself, Mishka.
4	I think we should talk.
4	It's urgent!
4	Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
4	Death comes closer for us all.
4	What's killing all the children?
4	But they turned the lights down this time and didn't say this is a drill.
4	I need your help.
4	How are you going to stop them?
4	I ended up in the hospital.
4	I hate this place.
4	Shit!
4	I hope Jacovich isn't watching.
4	If that's true, we were guilty.
4	You'd better leave that bandage alone, unless you want to start bleeding again.
4	I contacted the police, I contacted the FBI.
4	They're coming to get you, Barbara.,
4	You're going to set this whole place on fire.
4	Majesty, have mercy on me!
4	feet and rising, sir.
4	Embarrassing, Your Majesty?
4	But the water was dangerously low?
4	I mean, our smartphone has to be the smartest. - Yeah.
4	Mayday!
4	Well, I... my dad was a high-powered accountant.
4	May is a great scientist, but she also has destructive tendencies.
4	If the city can pay, we'll be humiliated.
4	Or-or maybe you mean embarrassing the badge.
4	Boy, that old character mut be a kook.
4	Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
4	There's nothing we can do about it.
4	Why look at me that so strangely?
4	Out! Get out!
4	They caught me on video and now they're threatening to press charges.
4	Once you're out of here never come back!
4	It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood, in every city and state in the country.
4	Please!
4	In the dream, the destroyer's destroyed.
4	And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar, the rat catcher.
4	What's going on?
4	The cellar is the only safe place.
4	No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...
4	Looks to me like we're in hot water already.
4	When I first took a deal to become an undercover informant in a biker gang, I did it to save my own skin.,
4	Kelly's dead?
4	He's peeking at us through the curtains.
4	Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.
4	Around about midnight, the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees.
4	Then I think you need to see a doctor.
4	I wouldn't want to face it.
4	One look from the head of Medusa can turn all creatures into stone.
4	Well, I-I believe... I believe things have gone far enough.
4	If one of them followed you, there's got to be more of them around.
4	We found the bomb.
4	I admit I was nervous.
4	I was desperate.
4	A whale can stave in the ribs of the biggest ships, swallow whole crews, pick its teeth with the oars.
4	I can't start acting like a father now.
4	Trouble is that the Kid might be nervous, big game like this.
4	Help me!
4	I'm scared.
4	You're not driving, are you?
4	Better get out of here... 'cause I ain't ever gonna surrender to Nodeen.
4	Help!
4	Oh, he ain't alone.
4	And the sociopaths that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to speak for planet Earth.
4	Miss Bianca, before anything else happens,
4	It's a train robbery.
4	They're out there.
4	We're all gonna die!
4	Tommy, why did you bring him here?
4	Let's use our fists
4	Monster! He's hiding my Kim!
4	Now they got  of that Englishman's goons, and more are coming!
4	I think sister Inviolata would be much better at it than me.
4	If you don't find Carolyn's killer, we are both history.
4	Hastings, we will leave this, up to the lawyer of the Mrs. Inglethorp to be present.
4	If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project, this bullet has your name on it, and it will find you.
4	I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
4	This girl's been in an accident, Marcy.
4	She's turning into a corpse monster!
4	As a so called one percenter motorcycle club, Vagos are notoriously violent.
4	Admiral know what that is?
4	I could not get it off, Swami.
4	Please hurry.
4	Hey, let me outta here!
4	Fine, except I'm scared to death.
4	It's awfully quaint, isn't it?
4	I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.
4	I am afraid of murder.
4	From any of those islands, he could launch a strike against Levu-Vana.
4	When that light hits the water, this boat will be compromised.
4	This is my life we're dealing with.
4	There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be, whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children.
4	We wouldn't last more than  hours before we had a fatal accident!
4	This itself may have placed the entire country's safety in jeopardy.
4	Martial law.
4	He was afraid of losing his job.
4	I tried to make him see a psychiatrist.
4	But what's that thing in my back pocket.
4	She's gonna kill him!
4	Liz, don't go to him!
4	She was gonna turn me in.
4	Save me from my enemies.
4	Now! - Let me go!
4	If they find out you're FBI, we have a problem.
4	Watch your head.
4	Uh, people will get hurt.
4	Mom, you must have had a bad dream, that's all.
4	It's a wonder we make a profit at all.
4	Captain, there's a few bodies up there.
4	But the rescue has to happen immediately.
4	Help him, Rexer. Ramos, you got rear! -I got one mag left.
4	Oh, God. Where's my wimple?
4	That butcher, Eggers, he'll take 35,head... and butcher them himself.
4	That task force is headed this way.
4	You think he'll be all right?
4	What do you mean, if anything happens to you?
4	We are going to explode! All right. Roger, .
4	What the hell is going on out there, George?
4	That butcher, Eggers, he'll take  head... and butcher them himself.
4	Uh-oh!
4	What if the police find you here?
4	Mr. Quinn... I'm in pain. I'm full of sedatives.
4	Or perhaps you should be careful.
4	I don't want to die.
4	I heard some shooting, Sheriff.
4	He embezzled five million euros and Christine was going to expose him?
4	Tuthill, sir, Operations.
4	I remember one on the porch, waiting in darkness so complete I couldn't see his face.
4	I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
4	I'd never fuck with you, because I really love you guys.
4	Are you okay?
4	No sense taking any chances in this thing.
4	If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory, it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage.
4	You could be talking about , , kids who have been victims of human trafficking.
4	This is just plain suicide, sir.
4	That's criminal.
4	I cannot fight.
4	What are you talking about?
4	What are you gonna do if one of them catches you?
4	You don't know who to trust.
4	God, what's our status?
4	Watch out!
4	I'm sorry.
4	I hope not.
4	Get 'em out!
4	And Juliette was trying to kill him.
4	All right, for those people on the street, if there's any trouble, collapse on the house. Those inside, stay inside.
4	Oh, Nick, Nick, it's happening.
4	My mommy hurt my head.""
4	I'm Ensign Torrey, sir.
4	Rocky, no!
4	My God, she's coming inside. Oh, God.
4	What if they trace that call?
4	Call the police.
4	What in the name of Jupiter's balls are you doing out here alone, lady?
4	Please don't hurt us.
4	I was going nearly crazy 'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba.
4	What did you tell him about you and Ms. Polhemus?
4	And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word, but, shit.
4	Help!
4	He's still emotionally unstable.
4	Storm the bastille!
4	I have something inevitable to tell you.
4	I've got a little problem.
4	Get me out of here.
4	It's dangerous.
4	I suppose when a fellow bucks up against a big organisation like that, one man by himself can't get very far.
4	No, Your Majesty!
4	Well, the Kid hit him once, and he ain't come back yet.
4	Come down. - It's making you nervous?
4	Are they gonna get in?
4	Did I ...
4	What's the matter, Matt?
4	You know what they say about black cops in the ghetto?
4	I don't think we can hold out that long before they find her.
4	A vampire...
4	I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story, but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government!
4	I saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming.
4	I am also concerned about the misinformation about nuclear waste.
4	I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze.
4	Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords?
4	May I ask what you're planning?
4	Every day it was worse.
4	Oh my God!
4	They found my fingerprints on a glass of beer in her apartment.
4	Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours.
4	We need to warn Monroe and Rosalee.
4	In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships.
4	What's with you lately? I'll take care of this.
4	Ghosts?
4	Drop that gun and let me walk out.
4	We thought they might be weapons directed against us.
4	I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
4	Slow down or you'll get a ticket!
4	There's trouble down here.
4	I don't believe you. - You can't accuse me, sir.
4	I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.
4	Get off my back. I want to go home.
4	The public's not calm.
4	It can't be a coincidence it lays out this way, Sandy.
4	We ran those prints through the federal computer. Turns out they belong to one Carol Hunnicut. She's arrested for disorderly conduct in , in Oregon, some kind of antinuke bullshit.
4	I don't want to lose you.
4	You have to stay indoors to avoid them.
4	Fellas, we gotta be alone.
4	Haven't I told you you're gonna get your melon opened?
4	You've got to stop!
4	No, it's just... I read in this thing that's what I'm supposed to do.
4	Can we get there without being seen?
4	We... we have a few more questions to ask.
4	But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator.
4	I mean... except with you.
4	A vast area would be uninhabitable, with many cancer cases later.
4	There was no way I could get in touch with my husband.
4	Oh, Jesus.
4	No, no, no.
4	Jane could be killed.
4	Can you still keep going on?
4	I want you to pull over and stop so's we don't have an accident or worse.
4	God better help them and help you, too.
4	If he starts convincing those senators, you might as well blow your brains out!
4	I'm attacked from all sides!
4	If he found out, he'd insist upon doing it himself if he had the money, which I doubt.
4	Pa's no killer!
4	You do it again, and you lose a limb.
4	What the hell was that? !
4	Right in the middle of our celebration... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack.
4	Oh, my God.
4	It may endanger the very peace and stability of England.
4	Please, I beg you.
4	A deception?
4	When I say run, run.
4	Because we need to look just like them if we want to pass unnoticed.
4	Mom?
4	He-- he's a friend.
4	It's a matter of life and death!
4	I've just heard a startling piece of news.
4	He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times, and how, on the night of the murder, she not only smashed his radio but hit him.
4	It's gonna take some getting used to, isn't it?
4	Ask him how we'll get outta here.
4	Yeah, no, no!
4	We've heard from Kennedy Approach that we've run into a traffic problem.
4	Th-the news I wanted to tell you.
4	Until it took a hit in the head.
4	What the fuck you doing?
4	The bastard Hu betrayed us
4	A force of nature capable of giving rise to all things wicked?
4	Might as well be a hundred.
4	Don't answer it.
4	Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
4	How do I know you'll jump?
4	Well, now I want to be loved.
4	Everything's going so fast, man!
4	Better jump into the tree and hide
4	I've been doing some checking on you, Mr. Caulfield.
4	When I say run, run.
4	What the hell were you doing diving there?
4	I mean, I realize you don't have to answer me, but don't forget I helped you into this world, okay?
4	No unpleasantness, I hope.
4	What is it, Meatball?
4	Don't!
4	You're turning into a zombie.
4	Have you been too little?
4	Call Dr Dixon.
4	Please be more careful in the future, Captain.
4	Be careful, you'll put my cigar out.
4	I couldn't hate you, so my hatred turned into an insane fear.
4	Nobody better have a cold.
4	I'm afraid to let her try.
4	I can't see myself.
4	I heard you ran into some trouble today.
4	Paul could've been killed by that intruder.
4	What's it gonna cost me?
4	Fine! But I'm not making a speech.
4	Send somebody for the militia.
4	You're nuts!
4	What am I gonna do when she has a baby?
4	Drive!
4	I've put the gun down.
4	Then they'll kill him.
4	When does it happen? When?
4	I just wanna go home.
4	The reality however is much different.
4	Where'd he touch you, boy?
4	I'm going after her.
4	Don't shoot!
4	This kid has taken a savage beating.
4	Marty Weiner has disappeared.
4	It's not going to be easy.
4	A man was killed in his plane and bled all over him.
4	Now, you may kill me, but if you don't come to your senses and throw it down, they're gonna kill you.
4	You think Madison's gonna buy that?
4	It's not mine, man.
4	It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
4	Can't they find him?
4	Why aren't they firing?
4	Ain't no way in the world I'm goin' up that path.
4	Stay away from me!
4	He's going to get us into trouble.
4	No! Windy!
4	I'll try, but she's in danger, Marco.
4	But if Eben's an angel, why ain't he in Heaven?
4	To tell you the truth, New York frightens me.
4	Oh, for Pete's sake, don't say anything about that around here.
4	If we yield to blackmail from this man, we'll become a laughing stock!
4	But, what if it doesn't work?
4	Occupational hazard?
4	Hope this thing don't go off while I'm climbing down.
4	She will! You're listening to a sick girl!
4	If it was in all  states, not good.
4	He's gonna kill her.
4	Oh, boundless heaven and earth Help me!
4	Your parents'll kill me.
4	They make me.
4	Said it was ghastly.
4	These terrorist attacks are aimed at you.
4	I don't know what Tom is... now.
4	Except the way she was killed.
4	I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate.
4	Let me out, or I'll kill myself.
4	If we didn't have a price on our heads, we'd get out of this hole.
4	Stay with me.
4	I guess since I'm here, I got no choice, huh?
4	It's horrible.
4	So is it true that if you commit a sin out of fear it is not necessarily a sin after all?
4	What am I gonna do, Clark?
4	Faster? ! ...
4	Shut it down!
4	Please, let's go!
4	It's not right. I'm gonna go check it out.
4	We throw ourselves at your mercy.
4	Nobody's going to come looking for him?
4	Are you saying he's dead? Not lying down dead, my friend.
4	You ever heard of the Vagos?
4	That thing's not for real, is it?
4	A man dropped you off unconscious. Who?
4	Ladies and gentlemen, these photos depict horrors...
4	And lock your doors while you're driving, Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers Can come up to your car.
4	Mister, is this Heaven here or not?
4	King Willie says not only do I have to kill you,
4	It's a cruel disease.
4	And then there is always a possibility that... - you won't survive that long.
4	If we keep our stern to the wind, we'll roll over.
4	I'll kill you all!
4	No.
4	This thing that's killing your people and mine is from the other side.
4	I hate to do this, but I think we better get him to a hospital.
4	And if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900,men out of work.
4	And as I was relating this to him, our missiles started shutting down one by one.
4	All the Nuke you'll ever need.
4	What happened?
4	Are you sure?
4	Please, we need help!
4	What is it?
4	Please, I'll go to the old ladies' home if you don't do something.
4	Isn't Leonardo's death enough?
4	I do not want unnecessary scandal. You have not to preoccupy yourself with that.
4	So what'd you do?
4	I didn't mean to kill him.
4	They're gonna get nervous.
4	I thought you got lost.
4	We need to leave now.
4	Sort of takin' the long way, aren't ya?
4	Somebody, help us.
4	Yeah. Too good.
4	You had me worried there for a moment.
4	Let's get her!
4	Destroy everything?
4	So, if we destroy the camera, they'll have no choice but to come in and film you themselves.
4	The guy was just talkin' about gettin' a shot.
4	I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate.
4	Alessandro, I am in danger.
4	I ain't through talkin' with you yet!
4	I didn't hurt anyone!
4	A dead animal!
4	I can't tell you about it.
4	Inside there's a huge creature
4	Shit's gonna hit the fan.
4	Sister Liz, I've got to give the girls their Religious Studies class in fifteen minutes.
4	As in... pointless.
4	Sir Harry wants his money, fast!
4	What do you mean?
4	Somebody help me, please.
4	The Navy's waiting for me to make a mistake, but I won't make it.
4	Stop, please.
4	I am so sorry. Hi, buddy!
4	My son's missing since last night.
4	This is a mistake.
4	Listen, I know why you've come.
4	Cover him up, quickly.
4	It sounds to me like you have an agenda.
4	That was close, mate.
4	Isabelle. Isabelle, are you all right?
4	I'm afraid.
4	Dude, there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
4	He's afraid I'll tell the truth about my relationship with Carolyn...
4	I can't keep this from the president any longer.
4	All I ask of you is be careful.
4	I will get Fornell out of the way.
4	It doesn't fear my incantations!
4	And that's the way it was.
4	Don't you realise that I don't have that sort of money?
4	No, don't do it.
4	Are you gonna faint?
4	Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry, but I...
4	You must go, go at once, before Henry catches you here.
4	I'm getting numb all over.
4	Rocky, you're losing your family!
4	I don't think you hear very well. I am not testifying at this trial.
4	This deficit has grown to alarming proportions.
4	This is as far as we dare to take you.
4	What do they want with us?
4	I declare, Billy, sometimes I think you got psychic powers.
4	And her blood is a deadly venom.
4	I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did.
4	Hurry up!
4	A bomb?
4	An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends.
4	I had the most frightening experience.
4	That's quite a knife you carry.
4	It makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone.
4	l pumped your stomach. Oh, God.
4	I mean I can't swim.
4	I-I came to this country to pursue the American dream.
4	Hey, wait for me.
4	I should say not.
4	Clive, Ned, I'll tell you something.
4	What are we doin' here?
4	Aarfy, if anything happens to me, will you take care of my girl?
4	Yes, well, I don't know anything about it.
4	He used to make me bend over while he whipped me with his belt.
4	Well, that broke that up.
4	It's all coming apart, Al.
4	I told him you guys wanted out as well.
4	Open your eyes!
4	We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.
4	His blood?
4	I really can't believe it.
4	Am I a criminal for that?
4	I only hope it isn't too high for you here.
4	This blood is mine! Do you understand? The blood is mine!
4	It will make them sick.
4	I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze.
4	My heart is weak, and I'm too old.
5	Sweet!
5	How about that? Hey, you're pretty handy to have around, kid.
5	I think I love you.
5	But with a nice sort of craziness.
5	I thought you was dead.
5	Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight. Not when you're mayor of a major city!
5	Maggie!
5	Say we'll be happier there than ever.
5	Hey, she loves those flabellina oculina!
5	We can talk about it tonight.
5	Aw, jeez! Look at these guys.
5	Hey, honey.
5	I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change.
5	Thank you for all your help tonight.
5	Wow! That's perfect.
5	At any rate, gentlemen, a charming, exquisite woman.
5	I'll take my chances.
5	Look at those darling dogs.
5	Hsiao-tsing, we're safe!
5	I hope you have a nice stay in New York.
5	Decker's been calling again.
5	Why, this was given to me by a very dear friend.
5	I know you like the way I feel.
5	This is better, it's made out of real cotton.
5	He's given us like a second shot, right?
5	Ah, thank you.
5	Produces beef, beer, shoes... and good times.
5	Only in America do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event.
5	Well, ain't that good?
5	It's wonderful.
5	He'll be a champ.
5	You don't realise what a plum you are for us.
5	It looks lovely to me, Céline.
5	Okay, we have fruit juice, soda, Mudslides are blending, Or I can make you a daiquiri, if you prefer.
5	Tell him I can't insult the owner with such an offer.
5	It must be smooth like velvet.
5	And it's a miracle old Billy's alive today.
5	I'm very fond of my wife and kid.
5	But I would love to hang out with you again.
5	I know where it is.
5	♪ A media-opoly ♪
5	We throw our thumbs in the air and hitchhike.
5	I love him that way.
5	It was a gift from an admirer who said I was always late.
5	Thanks.
5	Never tasted better. There's a fork on your left, Mr. Land...
5	Dad, did you know your bones grow three times as fast at night?
5	You and McLeod make two nice goddesses.
5	I like your tailor.
5	One two three!
5	More shopping?
5	We belong here.
5	Pleased to meet you.
5	You have the most beautiful place here.
5	I've always been in love with you.
5	Only two months' treatment, and I'm a well man.

5	Hey, it's another delightful day here in vacation land.
5	I know a place that does a good breakfast.
5	The good news is Kid here has agreed to sponsor you as a Prospect.
5	And who's the happy father?
5	There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies, or compromise with human liberties.
5	Oh, you're the best, Joe.

5	Okay.
5	As you know, over here, crime is not exploited to sell newspapers.
5	I did it.
5	Well, why you not make her dance more?
5	I'm not going to say Omega's the best house on campus... but a lot of outstanding guys figure they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.
5	And then, I see your face.
5	All right, I'm coming in.
5	Isn't that an intriguing challenge?
5	Isn't that extraordinary?
5	I thought of you.
5	So warm, so smooth.
5	Isn't that her dancing with that nice-looking young fellow over there?
5	I know, but it's too bad that wrestler Had to die for me to get it.
5	I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates.

5	Terrific.
5	May I? May I?
5	I like the feel of it, Griffin.
5	Ahoy, there!
5	Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.

5	You make me laugh.
5	The performance was superb.
5	I love you anyway.

5	It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home, for England!

5	If we can force them to come in and face us, we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape.
5	Hank Aaron, that's a winner.
5	And without actual damages...
5	That is the original invitation.
5	Yeah, she's wonderful.
5	Isn't that wonderful, father?

5	The press release said that you were taking a leave to consider your career options.
5	I don't know what you're training' for, but as far as I'm concerned, you're ready. Look!
5	In this business, one should joke a little.
5	There you go.
5	That night I got a grip on life again.
5	Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake?
5	Handy little thing, isn't it?
5	Oh my God! You totally should.

5	So we might as well have a good time.

5	Oh, great, Hal.
5	Are you comfortable?
5	Evan, I care about this woman.
5	Jesus, you're weird.
5	At that point, I pulled out the phone book and I started contacting attorneys.

5	Hey, fella.
5	Come give your grandfather a hug.
5	You folks have a nice trip.
5	I'll take care of him.
5	It would adore. Mary, Hastings, come to my office a moment.
5	Yeah, that would be good.

5	Hey, that's got a nice ring to it, kid.
5	You've all won first prize.
5	She said she thought it was very thoughtful of me.
5	You are brilliant this morning!

5	Aye, aye, sir.
5	Glad to see I'm not the only case you're working.

6	You're supposed to say something.
6	Sorry. - Sorry to wake you.

6	My face and my body have aged.
6	This is not a good place for you.
6	You got it bad.
6	Listen, Tommy.
6	Okay, that didn't help at all.
6	It's also possible to look at this in, really, just a slightly different way, which is just as sad, maybe even sadder.
6	If you would've had four fours, you would've won.
6	We never had a nursery, Marlowe.
6	Forget it.

6	No, you can't leave, you're like the coolest thing about this place.
6	What will happen to you after I've gone? They like hearing my stories
6	Berlin laughed at my theory.
6	He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times, and how, on the night of the murder, she not only smashed his radio but hit him.
6	It's been a long year.
6	He's mad. It was an accident.

6	Sorry.

6	You see. we're not like you think we are.
6	I didn't even have time to wash my hair today.
6	We're going now, and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.

6	Shall I go?
6	Who was killed?
6	I'll never have a girl like that"
6	You murdered your own brother. -You murdered your brother.
6	Not exactly.
6	No. That's another lie, isn't it?
6	It's no use anyway.
6	Sorry, nothin' but beer.
6	Borden is dead.
6	There's still places I want to see and things I want to do.
6	Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways.

6	I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?
6	I don't have casual affairs.
6	You know, I still expect him to come home for dinner.
6	I can't do this.
6	I'm here to tell you you've made your point.
6	Then, you still believed you could make a difference.
6	How can I?
6	I'm not playing at being provost marshal. And I never heard of luck that didn't run out.
6	It would be a pity if you died, not me
6	I can still smell her aroma.
6	I have all this money, and no dress.
6	Never you mind.
6	I'm terribly sorry.
6	My brother took all your cigarettes? I have another pack.
6	Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
6	They meant nothing.
6	He got a little sick.
6	Oh, I'm sorry.
6	I used to use my hands.

6	I wanted to hurt a pimp. That's what I wanted to do.
6	Paige...
6	I am afraid to have said some things to Emily what she will not forgive so early.
6	And you've been resenting me.
6	I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've got to get some air.
6	I don't feel so wonderful.
6	Cooper, no!
6	I don't know.
6	I hate myself for not using cutaways.
6	Oh, no!
6	I'm distraught to hear that.
6	He talks about the great lie"."
6	Are you crying?
6	Maybe you're sorry you married me now, Doc.
6	It's just beginner's luck.
6	And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment, which we do not and which we will prove.
6	I was state-raised... and this is a dead place.
6	My unit's due to be shipped out soon.
6	I think an apology...
6	I'm just so scared.
6	We have to get her to a doctor.
6	It's all I've got left.
6	You've never known.
6	Were you close with the deceased?
6	I told you that swords are too dangerous!
6	Nobody understands us.
6	Isn't that what's wrong with the world today?
6	I barely know her. I found her like this and I brought her here.
6	I hope this hurts.
6	Like myself, it struggled blindly for the means to live.
6	I tried one of them once, but she didn't show any enthusiasm at all.
6	Is there no justice in the world?
6	You scared me.
6	We had something special, but it's over.
6	I tried to enlist, they told them to me that I was too ancient.
6	I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out.
6	Yeah, I'm afraid it is, Tess.
6	I'm going to need you to put your hands up.
6	But I want to be alone.
6	That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are.
6	It made her sick.
6	You hate him....
6	No, I don't even want to do that.
6	Cos I think that people die sometimes when they don't wanna live no more.
6	Ever since the club split up, I missed you. We all missed you.
6	I don't want to hear this!
6	They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten, but I'm past that now so...
6	Three men killed, and to what end?
6	But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying... to show me that I could never mean any more to you... than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
6	Then what are you gonna come home to?
6	You've failed.
6	It's too stupid. Perhaps.
6	I slaved for you for over ten years without even a raise or a promotion.
6	Abandoned... Like someone left for dead...
6	Unfortunately for you and everybody in this room, his deals fell through because the market dried up.
6	Whatever I lost, I lost a long time ago, and I don't plan on losing more.
6	It's kind of sad, though. All that money and nobody to enjoy it.
6	I mistakenly trusted these demons and slaughtered righteous officials To atone for my sins
6	All the officers were disloyal.
6	Unhappy Brom, already bested at every turn, saw himself once more outmatched.
6	They're pretty hopeless.
6	Running around in that eye paint ain't gonna get you nowhere, boy.
6	I really love her and she likes me.
6	I don't see myself in one of those bullshit nine-to-five jobs.
6	The people with the money in their hot little hands put her up there, and she could do no wrong.
6	You must have loved your Grimm.
6	Ma'am, she's no longer a minor. There's nothing we can do. But, but, but.
6	Thirty years a Sheriff and all I've had to contend with are vicious animals.
6	Don't.
6	You've forgotten, this is the th century.
6	You disapprove, sir?
6	No. - Really not?
6	I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble.
6	You might have noticed I've got a slight weight problem.
6	Could we just go over one or two more...
6	You know too much.
6	Anyway you can't go to the hospital.
6	I've been in all night.
6	You're gonna leave your team?
6	Let's keep this a perfect memory... and someday this bitter ache shall pass, my sweet.
6	It will get me in much trouble.""
6	It breaks my heart.
6	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, you know...
6	And I've loved something that doesn't really exist.
6	Julio, will we be lonely tonight?
6	Yeah, I um, I just... just thought I saw something, but I can't really, um, trust my eyes these days.
6	No, I would... I would remember something like that.
6	I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all.
6	This is no time to play in the snow.
6	What must have been painful and difficult questions for you... Considering your relationship to the defendant.
6	It hurts, but he doesn't show it.
6	I can't keep this from the president any longer.
6	She was very nervous when we left New York.
6	Why, her last words were about you.
6	It's... Not that big a deal.
6	I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.
6	He wasn't much good, though.
6	He died kind of slow.
6	I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility, like, we do now.
6	My magical powers are no good at all
6	When I think of that kid, I want to cry.
6	No.
6	It ain't all that easy, son....
6	We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up.
6	This is a dreadful miscarriage.
6	Bad news. Your father cleaned out your bank account to pay for the damage to his store.
6	The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking, the more Backpage comes up.
6	If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do.
6	I don't want to raise him by myself.
6	I saw the little girl was hurt.
6	Then there were some who just got tired of living.
6	See, back then, a man's name was the same as his occupation.
6	But if Eben's an angel, why ain't he in Heaven?
6	And I cried the whole time.
6	Nancy, I don't want to leave like this.
6	I wanted good things for you.
6	And I panicked, and I lied.
6	We've got to keep... Keep daddy happy.
6	I'm going now to the church for confession.
6	You must forgive me.
6	I don't need you falling apart on me.
6	The helicopter was destroyed, and the pilot is dead.
6	You mean you don't love him anymore?
6	We tried that route, but we gave up.
6	No one asked her to worry about me...
6	Stay with me.
6	It's cold.
6	But it was that that looked.
6	I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
6	The sea shall have you back.
6	Before the bomb went off yesterday, do you recall seeing this man?
6	But the war had changed him.
6	We can't do this to him!
6	You insist on putting me into a position that I don't in the least relish.
6	I don't know what I'd...
6	He's put his neck on the chopping block.
6	Sorry, pal.
6	You all right?
6	I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years.
6	How can we be sure she'll help us free the Childlike Empress?
6	You know, you-you could get hurt. You shouldn't go around robbing people. You could go to jail.
6	We didn't have a mortgage.
6	There's no reason for me to be here.
6	It's moving back against the wall.
6	I still killed three women.
6	The other day, you looked like you were still hurting.
6	We have to save each other, because all victims are equal.
6	You killed him.
6	Egan was killed.
6	Mishnev is still dead.
6	You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?
6	You were going to give me that statue.
6	Why don't you let me help you?
6	It's hard, this fight.
6	I was just an ensign.
6	He ain't gonna make it.
6	Why didn't you write to me?
6	I know about abnormal behaviour.
6	I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars... and dreams of victory.
6	Stay with me.
6	Right, because it's a long shot. You could never love me back.
6	I should stay where I belong.
6	She figured out where the kids are being held, and she wants us to go rescue them.
6	Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
6	It was no self-defense, Brennan took him out.
6	I'd say you were the only man I ever loved.
6	There isn't anything to do.
6	Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
6	My heart behaved like a fool.
6	I've been missing you a lot lately.
6	I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
6	And what most people don't see... is just how hard it is to do the right thing.
6	Forgive me.
6	The drinking, the drugs, that's not a regular thing for me.
6	I'm sorry that I could not divulge the truth to you of all men.
6	I don't like to.
6	We were robbed!
6	He's hurt bad.
6	Why do you bother with her, eh? She's nothing but trouble.
6	So I say,  l don't know."
6	This cutter's broken.
6	It hurts a little.
6	You cannot come to the hospital, Barley.
6	So, I take it you've been busy.
6	You, too, think I am too old, too ugly for a man to look upon with love.
6	I forget a lot of things and I...
6	Three of your neighbors were killed last night.
6	To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honourable state.
6	She's very unhappy.
6	I hope I never get old and have to be in a wheelchair and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church.
6	I know, Bob, but...
6	It wasn't about the money, it was just about the anger.
6	Poor man's Bela Lugosi.
6	Well, too much TV is bad for my ears.
6	I'm not sure how much good all this talking's doing.
6	Wouldn't you say that prison is my fate?
6	Anyway, um, I might need some help translating that.
6	Why did you take him then with me?

6	I was getting lonely upstairs, all by myself.
6	Almost.

6	I'm out of my mind?
6	She's down.
6	Then a wasp stung out my eye.
6	The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised.
6	There was no more innocence anywhere.
6	So alone.

6	I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.
6	I'm peeing my pants.
6	Happiness is something I know nothing about.
6	You better come back.
6	It isn't that. It's what Pete said.
6	I'm afraid I cannot accept your evaluation of Cdr. Owynn.
6	For these and all my sins of my past life, I am heartily sorry.
6	God, forgive me.
6	I'd waited so long!

6	Fine, fine. Say, Harry, something kind of important has come up...
6	He should be here with his family.
6	This is awful.

6	There's one on the back, but it's not the right one.
6	He didn't know...
6	Right now, I wish it had been.
6	I didn't see him again for five years.
6	He had to say goodbye to one of us and that's too bad.

6	I'm sorry.
6	Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'.
6	I wonder if it isn't a curse to be wised up like you and me.
6	It's a bitter substitute.

6	It hurts me when people laugh at you.
6	You cannot tolerate the faith in humanity, Because if you do, all this... The structure of your very existence,
6	Perhaps I have become, as you put it, obsessed by our name and our past, and the absence of our future, and by our paintings.
6	So, I'm guessing you didn't find my dad.
6	You'll go on without me.
6	I thought I could make a difference.
6	I couldn't get the cook on such short notice, so we're on our own.

6	She told about a mother who was full of hate, and how she got back the hate she gave.
6	We could have backed him up.
6	He shot himself.
6	She said she's not in a head-space for a relationship, with everything that's going on in the world.
6	I'm sorry to hear about your little loss.
6	She's very sick.
6	Well, if it's anyone's fault, I expect it's mine.

6	Now it's all one big mess.
6	My father tried to help her.
6	Hi! Hi Princess! This isn't really the best time right now.
6	He didn't like it.
6	You think that by saying, "I'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
6	I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all.
6	That's how wars start.
6	No!
6	I don't wanna go like this.
6	I didn't mean to offend you. I was just being me, you know?
6	I'm so sorry, grandma. No one wanted to tell you, but you're dying.
6	The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it.
6	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
6	I was hoping for a miracle, and it didn't happen.
6	Would you really wear a thing like that?
6	Why did you say Balboa's better?
6	Maybe he's got the flu or something
6	Would you really wear a thing like that?
6	You gotta fix this mess, be it how you fix it with your girl, or how you fix it with Jake, cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this.
6	I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been  or  at least once a week.
6	The most damning testimony... Comes from an abused and frightened child... Who overcame his fear and his pain...

6	She's kind of lost.
6	But if you care about us, you do not do this.
6	I give up!
6	That's the unholy pity of it.
6	As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.
6	We've lost our picture.
6	You hate guys like me, don't you?

6	This is terrible.
6	Ma'am, I don't know how to put into words the sorrow I feel.
6	I can't.
6	Well, I don't think I can do much, sir, but...
6	Sorry, sir. Careless.
6	I don't think we can get it done by Monday.
6	The boy's doing so poor these days, why not take him along and air him?
6	And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it.
6	You changed that, and you can't change it back.
6	He can't get a clear shot!
6	You could be talking about , , kids who have been victims of human trafficking.
6	I knew someone would get killed, but nobody listened.
6	You're good, but you're taking on a lot.
6	That's absurdly hypothetical.
6	Wait till somebody gets killed?
6	Yes, sir, I still have the scars.
6	After all, I had caused the girl considerable discomfort.
6	We were drilled like little soldiers.
6	I don't care because he sure as hell knew after.
6	I had no right to put you through all that.
6	But you would have gone ...
6	What if an RD conks out?
6	Well, I suppose I should thank you.
6	My old friend. Not safe.
6	I understand.
6	I wish I could share your confidence.
6	If that's what the grown-ups have done with this world, we have to start those boys' camps and see what the kids can do.
6	We all have to sacrifice something.
6	We'd have got married, had a house and children.
6	My father died of a heart attack.
6	You got old.
6	Whatever I was, that was a long time ago.
6	I want to die in my own land, where Human Beings are buried in the sky.
6	He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope... and gives the slow death of slavery.
6	I think some were stolen.
6	Take me home.
6	I was running out of things to say.
6	I'm not at my best over the phone.
6	I'm sorry, maybe you don't want any company.
6	No.
6	I know how you feel, but don't ask me to do anything that'll break my heart.
6	I'm really not sure.
6	How can you think that I could do a thing like that?
6	You meet somebody and you only got one night to really get to know them.
6	I'm going to jump.
6	Who-Who? Who's sick?
6	You must get lonely.
6	I'm sorry about this.
6	Nothing more.
6	This is all I'm capable of right now.
6	No.
6	I wish I was.
6	I'm leaving.
6	But then you have to live with it.
6	I've had the flu.
6	I did it.
6	Poor boy.
6	And she got in a car accident.
6	How far does a girl have to go before you'll notice her?
6	My brothers. sister. and I been moving from town to town Looking for a place to call home.
6	I'm afraid we lost our patient.
6	I can't stand it anymore.
6	Why can't we have pancakes?
6	Sorry about the Chiefs, Reg.
6	Mine left me too.
6	I get so bored I could scream.
6	Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised.
6	You think it was me that beat you?
6	It's all coming apart, Al.
6	I lied.
6	I didn't mean to scare you.
6	That's no way to remember him.
6	I bear them no malice. I'm sorry for them.
6	And I'm thinking that, well... maybe the mill's taking you away from me and Bonnie.
6	I'll always regret that I didn't.
6	Maybe we've forgotten how to hope.
6	If she was young and beautiful, I forgive you.
6	But he's dead.
6	Her face had shrunk, and her nose was red from crying.
6	Murder is very, very real.
6	It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more.
6	I'm just not up to my usual self.
6	Truth of the matter is I don't much like parties.
6	It's not an easy thing to do.
6	I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble.
6	No, I don't like it.
6	You thought that everything would happen behind your back, ... For your secret mission.
6	But don't look so gloomy.
6	Please, give me one more minute!
6	Why didn't you think of that?
6	I was crazy with jealousy.
6	I think he wants to die.
6	I thought we had an understanding.
6	I have to spend half my life waiting for these time clocks to open.
6	Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
6	I'm awfully unhappy, Mom.
6	You're not that person anymore.
6	I'm sorry to hear that, Lady Fingers.
6	I must have worn out your machine.
6	Subject is violently antisocial given to delusions of godhood. And he's hopelessly addicted to narcotics.
6	Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.
6	And if you don't take me to my hotel, that means I have to walk.
6	When was the last time you saw her?
6	I got what you gave me but I can't follow the instructions.
6	I could have finally gotten my yoga certification... It wouldn't have been.
6	It gives me a terrible pain.
6	My return to consciousness was a plunge into a new level of pain.
6	You're like another person.
6	Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek, wham, and it feels like your eye is going to explode?
6	Shot her, right outta the sky.
6	Honestly...
6	That's the only chance you got left.
6	Oh, him and his wife splitting up?
6	That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone.
6	Not much comfort.
6	I haven't heard the sound of home in a while.
6	It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be.
6	I'm so sorry.
6	It's just-- it's hard sometimes.
6	He let go of my hand. And I was lost.
6	It's good you no understand my mother. It's liar.
6	You hurt his feelings.
6	He didn't come to the man who trusted him and ask for help.
6	It doesn't make sense.
6	Don't cry, honey.
6	Sorry, boys.
6	I took a sabbatical, and I traveled. But no matter where I went, The memory of that awful night
6	It hasn't been all that pleasant for you, has it Mr. Sanders?
6	I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you.
6	But I can't play them with you.
6	You'll go too far.
6	So you do not recognize me?
6	I didn't know anything about this.
6	I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.
6	No. If Edward were with me...
6	I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home.
6	I read it in a report this morning and...
6	He's dying.
6	What did Loomis say to get you so upset?
6	But when the sick one is yourself, you cannot run away.
6	For us, business is lousy.
6	To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
6	I killed her! I killed her like she was an animal.
6	I have to kill people to live.
6	I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
6	I've been stuck here for 20,years.
6	It will happen, as it does for all of us.
6	It could break us financially.
6	My father's in the hospital again.
6	The director is not the problem. It's the insurance company. They won't cover you if you do drugs.
6	Howdy's got worms.
6	Yeah, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.
6	It hurts, hurts, hurts.
6	When they looked back, they saw the body of Little Man lie down among his friends.
6	The King wants to take the wife of his cousin.
6	Yes, I noticed you'd packed.
6	How can you be so cruel and unfeeling?
6	He wasn't much good, though.
6	I didn't know... that she was in trouble.
6	I hope I never wake up.
6	When I was a little girl, like so many others, there was no money to buy shoes for me,
6	I was hoping you'd be spared all this.
6	You're going bald too.
6	A queen has no hour for love.
6	No, not perhaps"."
6	You envy us. And what you envy...
6	They took his coat.
6	( sobs ) - daddy. - Yeah, bud?
6	This is a fucking nightmare.
6	My wife went to a lot of trouble.
6	I suggest you keep that promise.
6	I don't want to sound like a Debbie the Downer, but no matter how many times you come up against the Communications Decency Act it's always gonna shut you down.
6	I screamed, but no one listened.
6	Go! Out of here!
6	We don't know where the hell we are.
6	But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on.
6	I wish I could spend more than two hours with you.
6	That's the way it's been your whole life.
6	I just want to have my shipyard.
6	You only pretended to be my friend.
6	I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation, but that is when it started.
6	I am what I look like!
6	A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder.
6	I think I hurt him.
6	Poor child.
6	I should have fired him when we fired Nico.
6	I concluded that this was not an objective study.
6	I got enough problems with my old man.
6	I'll miss you.
6	I'm very upset, Charlie.
6	About New York, I don't think this is really the best time.
6	Look, I was a bit of an asshole.
6	He didn't look well last night.
6	I miss the time when I had you to myself every day.
6	Our kids, struggling through their lives.
6	Why don't you like him?
6	Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
6	I was never really sure which one I got, nutrition or discipline.
6	He was Suellen's beau, and he loved her, not me.
6	Why did you choose Chipping Sodbury? There is a convent there!
6	I shall always think about it.
6	I'm afraid we must go, dear.
6	She flipped and tried to kill herself.
6	I'd rather take a whipping than mend fences.
6	I'm telling you, I thought I was the best.
6	It was our last evening together.
6	And then I-I don't know what happened.
6	Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless.
6	That's when they start to drift away.
6	You really should be AM and FM...
6	You won't get him.
6	It doomed me forever to middle management, and that's the truth.
6	Two destroyers hit by mines...
6	l don't want to hurt a cop.
6	I...
6	Take this and start a new life for yourself. Somewhere off this bus, okay?
6	When an hour alone with you was an impossibility.
6	Yeah. Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.
6	But Lawrence never speaks with me, it will be possible to avoid it.
6	What bothers you?
6	Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
6	It was certainly a heart attack!
6	She's been through enough.
6	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
6	I'm sorry they don't like me.
6	I'm awfully sorry.
6	He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope... and gives the slow death of slavery.
6	I'm sorry to hear that, Lady Fingers.
6	We must have missed him.
6	Oh...
6	I think that I'm pretty enough, but I would not want to be that kind of star.
6	You don't seem very excited about it.
6	Some things you just don't tell anybody.
6	If there was a bum within  miles, I was completely attracted to him.
6	You're just saying that.
6	I'm a sex trafficking survivor.
6	Oh, I'm awfully sorry, everybody.
6	I mean, he had a great sense of humor. He wasn't another junkie with a homemade  mm.
6	I'm sorry, Nick.
6	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
6	Your beloved business manager, Marty Weiner the man you stayed with, the one I begged you to leave....
6	I'm so pissed at you! I'm really pissed, OK?
6	I'm sorry.
6	You can't afford this.
6	I thought you'd be onto me if anyone was. ""
6	She's vulnerable, wide-open to be hurt badly.
6	I'll do a better job. You're so out of it, you'd botch that up.
6	Well, duty calls.
6	I don't want any locked doors between me and him.
6	Yakov is taken.
6	Oh, kids, I'm so sorry!
6	I'm supposed to be taking care of you.
6	A captain's job is a lonely one.
6	I'm in bad shape.
6	Scarlett, if you knew what I've gone through!
6	So much for old business.
6	Uh, people will get hurt.
6	There's no time...
6	The cheque is no good.
6	It's over.
6	If you die, your type will be extinct
6	I know. I miss him too.
6	And he will be missed.
6	I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. You'll have to kill your dog.
6	Oh, here you are...
6	Felix, I have the most terrible news for you.
6	Might not get another chance.
6	Some official's son got in trouble and they're looking for a substitute
6	I live in a fucking bed-sit.
6	But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you.
6	That's not good.
6	No, I just thought we could spend the day together.
6	Gone.
6	That girl doesn't exist anymore.
6	Maybe you should've told her you loved her. Maybe that was the way to make sure.
6	What? That I'm your little puppet?
6	It's cold.
6	Yeah, but he's not gonna take me along any more, is he?
6	Another example of the pastoral beliefs you Anglicize.
6	It's horrible!
6	Oh, God, no. Oh, no.
6	Mother, I'll have to skip your party tonight.
6	I'm leaving you, my dear.
6	No one really ever accepted me.
6	So be it. I will be the first corpse.
6	I'm sorry.
6	She's never cared for me.
6	Please, Johnny.
6	He had to go back to work.
6	You don't like me very much, do you?
6	I was too late.
6	I am dying, and The Nautilus is dying with me.
6	This hurts me in my heart.
6	Sunny California will not be that tomorrow.
6	You know I've been in situations, where, like, I've been shot at. You realize that, right?
6	You're all I ever had.
6	I'd be so happy if that were really true, Evelyn.
6	Yeah? The last time you assured me, I lost good men in the Kola Peninsula.
6	Look, Ned, I-I've known all along That you were stealing food and treasure.
6	I thought I was doing smart business.
6	And in a fit of anger, I told her that our being together, our rekindled romance, was a big mistake.
6	When we first went there, Ben, he could barely speak.
6	I could never do anything like that.
6	What the hell am I living around here for?"
6	Simply no use trying.
6	Oh, I am sorry.
6	People do when they've been ill.
6	The military has been mobilized, but the violence is so widespread that it is impossible for the rescue services to respond.
6	A depressing characteristic.
6	Then I lived in many European capitals, trying to forget something sad that happened long ago.
6	He leveraged himself up to his eyeballs. The investments didn't work out... He got himself in serious debt.
6	It's hard being a dope fiend.
6	I wanna feel good about something sometime.
6	I can not believe it.
6	We went to the very heart of the vessel... The propulsion unit.
6	Not necessarily, this country plays tricks with the eyes.
6	That isn't exactly living it up.
6	Since I'm a one-man show around here, I think I'll forgive myself this one time...
6	You reject it.
6	Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle, and I started drinking.
6	He must have killed a man.
6	It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.
6	They tried.
6	I just needed a break.
6	Ruby's been dead for 14,years.
6	The war in London.
6	No, jocelin, listen to me, I-- - no, it's just--
6	You'll lose your hair.
6	She never even went back to the room.
6	Something that no one's ever done for him before.
6	We are not important.
6	We need to leave now.
6	Some days I wake up--
6	It's fine.
6	You won't stay here, and I can't go with you.
6	First Louie, now Norm.
6	I could never do anything like that.
6	No she didn't. - Did you kill her?
6	You came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
6	Oh, your parents should be ashamed of themselves
6	I just think you're not gonna be able to go back to what you were.
6	You are quite right, and I do not have the right, but I do love Maria.
6	How many years to come?
6	That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are.
6	Hundreds and thousands of them died.
6	Looking back,
6	Her father murdered her mother.
6	He humiliated me!
6	I'm sorry to disturb you.
6	Then there's nothing left for me.
6	No!
6	I'm unhappy.
6	Marty Weiner has disappeared.
6	It's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.
6	If there were more time...
6	Nothing. Nothing.
6	Are you okay?
6	It's a lot of time, especially when it stands still with loneliness.
6	I don't trust them any more.
6	We don't understand.
6	I wish I could stay.
6	It's all so horrible, isn't it?
6	That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life.
6	Well, I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing.
6	If the city can pay, we'll be humiliated.
6	This is the society we could have had a century ago.
6	I can't.
6	My ex-wife is now in Long Island, in my ex-home with my ex-dog.
6	NCMEC has a slightly different view of its interactions with Backpage.
6	I'll start weeping with self-pity any minute.
6	You see that man giving screwface to Jake?
6	It's just you know that sometimes... Well, you're not wanted.
6	I just hate to see a good man go to waste.
6	Man, just look at him.
6	Time drags when you're tired.
6	You can stay at my house because nobody really cares about me.
6	I'm sorry, Willie.
6	My mommy hurt my head.""
6	Because I am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone.
6	Okay, well, it doesn't really matter now.
6	I disagree.
6	He never wanted me.
6	I can't get it out of my head that Junior was responsible for the camping thing.
6	Yes, sir, my apologies.
6	And he was so sorry for locking me up.
6	We were just talking.
6	An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to Russia.
6	I can't understand half of them and I used to be a lawyer.
6	It was blocking him from coming out.
6	I don't chase the nines.
6	I didn't get a chance to tell him.
6	They behead people at noon
6	Don't leave me!
6	I can't keep him. He's getting farther away.
6	But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about, either.
6	Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship.
6	But you'll never find another Maria.
6	It's a shame, isn't it?
6	What if I just lean back like this? Would you rescue me if I fell?
6	Some of them are carved in stone, some of them men like Taylor put up there, so suckers like me could read them.
6	I didn't mean anything bad.
6	Sounds awful, doesn't it?
6	I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
6	I guess she doesn't have nowhere else to go.
6	C'mon, rest awhile girl.
6	We'll miss the complimentary beverage.
6	My father hates him. My wife hates him.
6	What was your relationship with the deceased?
6	No! Windy!
6	He died a week ago.
6	Dad, they've got Johnny.
6	I ain't got any money.
6	But there's no support for this appealing idea.
6	It's as empty as ashes.
6	No, you have never loved me.
6	I never should've left.
6	How awful.
6	What would you do if it was your child?
6	Who are we gonna beat playing like that?
6	Bernard, I'm disappointed in you. Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help.
6	Harvey, the lawsuit's dead. We don't have a plaintiff.
6	Climbing on a heap of black and metal sheets and pilings... "...he hardly recognized the once proud and famous Silver City.""
6	I was crazy with jealousy.
6	Everyone sees this thing except me.
6	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel.
6	Päiväsi on lopussa
6	But the man I'm in love with doesn't.
6	Sorry for the slight inconvenience, Your Honor.
6	I can say no more.
6	I can't start the car.
6	Which, incidentally, the worst day of my life.
6	Everyone was in mourning.
6	I must not get too close to women
6	I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?
6	Carol hits the ceiling and throws me out.
6	I loved him, but you know...
6	And for that, I can never forgive myself.
6	He said no pilots.
6	Dad!
6	Daddy, I want Mommy!
6	I'm not doing it alone.
6	Daddy, there are balloons floating away.
6	I know how you feel.
6	We have diddly-shit.
6	Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
6	We're going to lose a man like Mike here for that?
6	Don't look so depressed.
6	Father, I'm at the end of my rope.
6	Christine, I can't make it so soon...
6	I am away, sick.
6	I don't have much time.
6	I've even... Maybe you won't admit it, but you love me. - Dani.
6	Daisy's leaving you.
6	There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
6	Bye-bye, baby.
6	You must love someone else.
6	I don't think even that would do it.
6	Everybody's waiting.
6	Come on, man.
6	It hasn't been easy, has it?
6	We lost Ben, go back!
6	No, I have not been away all that time.
6	Poor lamb.
6	Even when we rehearsed it, I felt something sad and tender.
6	Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime.
6	But there is a problem.
6	I don't know.
6	Can't I do what I think is right?
6	Certain camps where the men aren't paid enough or fed enough or protected against disease enough.
6	Damn!
6	Everybody's a screwball in some way.
6	Please come. Come and take me.
6	I yielded once before and was practically never heard of again.
6	Nick did everything he could, but they got away.
6	I don't wanna stay here without you.
6	Dear Mr. Horgan." "This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes.""
6	Dearest Leslie, your mother and I have brought you to this spot to share this last private... This moment of... Grief and pain.
6	Casualty report?
6	I get to live in a place... it's OK. Don't get me wrong. The air is clean.
6	Then if you did get me well and I went to him, you wouldn't like it.
6	Everything is cold and finished.
6	We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind.
6	Can't he stay? Tomorrow's not a school day.
6	I feel like such a fool.
6	No, don't! Not this one.
6	I have a kid. I have a kid. - Hmm?
6	I couldn't...
6	I didn't say you could move.
6	You have our deepest sympathy.
6	I wish it made me feel good too.
6	I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did.
6	I lost my head for a moment, but I couldn't help it.
6	Don't drink alone.
6	What'd she take? -Pills.
6	I said Because your husband is dead."
6	I can't afford the wheels.
6	We ain't had a chance to get this place too nice.
6	Come on, man. I feel fucked up already.
6	I don't feel very good.
6	Death everywhere and you and me in the middle.
6	I fell over my feet most of the time.
6	Oh, no!
6	Don't give us hunches.
6	I'm falling...
6	No, I don't love you.
6	Come on, lighten up.
6	You told me that when you overwork you get nervous and lose weight.
6	Death was from suffocation.
6	Everybody's waiting.
6	I have but one life... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny.
6	Well, this misery in my back... ain't so good.
6	But Sam is gone.
6	You don't like me, do you?
6	I told him my problem, I told him I loved you and he told me to keep my trap shut.
6	I'm just starting to feel like... Pretty alone.
6	Dickson will never stand for it.
6	I'll never be able to match that.
6	I can't let that happen again.
6	All I ever do is try to please you
6	Even if we die?
6	Nobody's going to come looking for him?
6	The deal with Tusk was a mistake.
6	We have to drop the case.
6	Please don't do this to me.
6	My wife, poor girl.
6	All I'm askin' for is a chance.
6	You let me down, Mike.
6	I just wanna feel better.
6	Set us free!
6	All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts.
6	I've been trying to find you, but...
6	Did I say something wrong?
6	But I was crying because I....
6	Grandfather, I think it's a good day to die.
6	It was horrible for him.
6	I hadn't the heart to warn her.
6	All that fighting in there wore me out.
6	Did you ever get my flowers?
6	Every time I think about it, I get sad and depressed, and I'm having flashbacks.
6	I don't want to put you to any trouble.
6	I am not the man you thought I was.
6	But you have to make a change to your life, put in some effort.
6	You just go.
6	I'm tired of being only three inches high.
6	I don't know.
6	Has decided to demolish ...
6	Nobody comes, nobody pays any attention.
6	Don't cry.
6	Perhaps I shouldn't have met him.
6	Am I, Max? - No.
6	That just can't be.
6	I must be going senile.
6	No matter how many you kill here you still won't save the kingdom The emperor is surrounded by sycophants and has no idea of the suffering of his people
6	Until a trial... When she sees her husband suffer... The way she never...
6	I wanted New York, but I wasn't counting on it.
6	We've got nothing to wear. What about our habits?
6	It is to you and you that my name means nothing.
6	I ought never to have married Frank.
6	But to speak of this, to anyone, would bring dire consequences.
6	I feel I should be doing something, but I don't know what.
6	We're home free.
6	I'm afraid the press has been alerted to your mother's presence here... -...and her arrest. -Oh, great.
6	Dominic tried to straighten her out.
6	Come on! No, no, I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium.
6	We don't belong here.
6	Everything is cold and finished.
6	Don't bother about me.
6	They do not know the hardships of the imperial court
6	You do look pale.
6	No. No, Juliette.
6	I really am nice, but you act like a fool around me.
6	I've missed so much!
6	What difference would it make?
6	But when you worry, darkness does something to you.
6	So tired.
6	Did you have a warrant?
6	You know, all fairness to alcohol, I've done stupid things when I was sober, too.
6	Everybody except me.
6	Even so, quite wrong to threaten. Not the way to treat an enlisted man.
6	Everything is part of the great lie.
6	I don't know what I'm going to do.
6	Catholic school. A little minor league ball, long enough to find out I couldn't hit a curve.
6	Life back over there is hard.""
6	Now that hurts. Because this was my intention from the very beginning.
6	It could work if the government would spend more money.
6	I fucked up.
6	I blame me. I'm the one who got her killed.
6	I'm not really. It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog.
6	Except never take drugs and go to AA meetings for the rest of your life.
6	No, for Philip and Elizabeth.
6	How could I have forgotten about Yin?
6	Well, like I said, right now, I've got a bigger problem.
6	Mine left me too.
6	I wouldn't want him to think I'm not sympathetic.
6	Just after she stopped seeing me.
6	Seems a shame to part company after all these years.
6	Charlie, have you thought how horrible it must have been?
6	The best died there.
6	I don't think Little Sheba's ever coming back, Doc.
6	That's when mine broke up.
6	What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand.
6	I worked for you.
6	Children, I have bad news for you.
6	Where are you taking it? - To the hospital.
6	But I am guilty.
6	Red boy. You know that's a white man thing, innit?
6	Why, her last words were about you.
6	I tried to make it easier for you.
6	How can you be so mean?
6	He died kind of slow.
6	I didn't like it.
6	I think the least people could do is to say they're sorry, or... something.
6	I hope it doesn't end here.
6	No.
6	I mean, it wasn't a bad little table.
6	Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.
6	I never thought we'd die here
6	I can't make it tonight.
6	Died thinking it might be over between us.
6	I don't want to.
6	Arguing's pretty much in my blood.
6	She always ruins everything.
6	Not until you've finished.
6	And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus.
6	Eighteen years on the force, six on Narcotics, four on Safe and Loft and the guy's never fired a gun.
6	I'm sorry, I have a bill...
6	But when I told the police, I do not think they believed me.
6	I just want you to leave me alone.
6	I'm going to have to leave the country if I ever want a breath of air.
6	How sad.
6	Trouble.
6	No, he's different! Please, Father, for me!
6	You know, I wanted to blame myself for that.
6	Disappointing.
6	I guess this must seem pretty pathetic to a guy like you.
6	The Shaffer woman died today.
6	You mean, Dad's not coming home anymore?
6	And that's all I can give you.
6	I still need it when I'm afraid, like a baby who needs a light on in the dark.
6	I am still jacked up. You wanna talk about a rush?
6	No! You know what you're full of, Seth Dove? Sin!
6	It doesn't happen often these days.
6	Don't be hard on yourself.
6	Don't drink alone.
6	I can't start acting like a father now.
6	I did not want to miss that.
6	But you were never there for me, Dad.
6	Carolyn would've fought back.
6	I can't do this.
6	It sometimes never goes away. How you talk.
6	I guess since I'm here, I got no choice, huh?
6	Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.
6	I had to torpedo him.
6	He probably doesn't remember me.
6	Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to could be so weak.
6	Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry, but I...
6	During the night, I was woken by Helena crying.
6	That was stupid and cruel.
6	Erik drowned the day before his fourth birthday.
6	One night, knowing his wife is out... He calls her and begs her to see him again.
6	Can you, can you, can you, meet me, please.
6	I can't go through it... You hear me?
6	It's too bad.
6	I do better with women, and they don't eat cigars...
6	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
6	My God.
6	I took some funds from the con-amalgate account, I... To cover a loan. I...
6	But I don't care about any of that now.
6	I can't, and God knows the department can't.
6	I didn't hurt anyone!
6	Do not.
6	No, I don't need time...
6	Don't leave me.
6	I guess I can't blame you.
6	Faced with that... regardless of my personal feelings for the boy, my sense of duty told me that his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer.
6	It was just like old times.
6	They ended up deciding that, you know, I could go ahead and do the oral argument.
6	You're wasting your time with me. I'm nothing.
6	But you're not enjoying yourself.
6	I'm hurt and...
6	We have no choice.
6	Can not afford a dowry to each of his daughters.
6	This is not my day.
6	Where'd he touch you, boy?
6	I guess one gets the face one deserves.
6	But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00.
6	She's won and I've lost.
6	That won't help you.
6	I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd.
6	What you have done?
6	I was dreadful.
6	Faced with that... regardless of my personal feelings for the boy, my sense of duty told me that his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer.
6	He thinks it's a wonderful evening and then she takes a handful of pills and overdoses.
6	Particularly child trafficking.
6	I can see I made a mistake.
6	I didn't come here for grief counseling. I came for my inheritance.
6	Fail!
6	All the poor young girls.
6	Rocky's been hit with bombs.
6	They have no husbands and they cry.
6	Why don't we see if we can find a nice place for her.
6	Do you have a boyfriend?
6	Convince yourself that way.
6	Don't make me feel like this.
6	Clearly, we didn't trust each other with them.
6	I am away, sick.
6	Do you know how many people are dying?
6	Bye, Commander.
6	You must rebuild what you've destroyed.
6	Goodbye, Mom.
6	It adds a few miles to our trip, but somehow I've become a little sentimental.
6	Alas, if he were brave this would not be necessary.
6	You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.
6	No. Well, I'll tell you what.
6	There's still places I want to see and things I want to do.
6	You'll never be sorry.
6	What do you have? What are you hiding?
6	Poor lamb.
6	You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body.
6	I don't have time.
6	Chappie, you said that if Brennan came up dirty, you won't take him in.
6	Ahem. Father brophy was very disturbed.
6	Can't watch it.
6	I'm sorry, gentlemen...
6	All my failings were preparations for meeting you.
6	Can we ever believe again?
6	I'm hungry.
6	And those working in the Manhattan Project developing the atom bomb were told that any secrets that they disclose would result in ten years in prison, or an equivalent of a $, fine.
6	A cop having a nervous breakdown might have shot two drug dealers. They might have.
6	I feel not much better now.
6	We'll never be parted again
6	I decline to answer your question. I decline to answer your question.
6	I'm afraid I've disappointed you.
6	You have to go on the road and I have to go through what I'm going through.
6	I behaved abominably.
6	No, I just... I just need a second, okay?
6	I have no close folks.
6	I lost my place.
6	Don't forget me, Bastian.
6	What's dying?
6	Completely out of our hands. -I don't accept that. -It's out of your hands.
6	Do you think nobody can tell?
6	I felt guilty about always being away from you and Papa.
6	We lost Ben!
6	Oh, no.
6	Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now.
6	I don't feel so good.
6	Do you think that I have forgotten all that has happened?
6	It's just beginner's luck.
6	Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.
6	Everybody's mother's got to die sometime.
6	And no promises on the sentence.
6	I'm just tired.
6	If that's true, we were guilty.
6	No.
6	All those guns and violence...
6	Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires?
6	And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon.
6	I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this.
6	And so I turned away my head and wept.
6	I don't know.
6	For an hour. An hour?
6	I just wanna go home.
6	But even so, it is quite awful when nobody in loves, is not?
6	You don't look excited.
6	My own husband was killed in this last war.
6	College degree, lovable personality... and I spend most of my time in prison.
6	Christ, he's been stripped.
6	A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place!
6	I was weak and tired, Listless, out of sorts, and...
6	You can't kill him.
6	I'm so clumsy. I'm sorry.
6	You keep avoiding me.
6	This strange coffee is a bore, but what can I do when I can't sleep?
6	I'm a sick man.
6	If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of, I would be willing to share all this... My records, everything.
6	Do you want to know everything?
6	I am not your horse.
6	Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.
6	The boat is gone.
6	I can't find the right words.
6	Fantasia will be forgotten.
6	It is too expensive to maintain, Leslie!
6	When did he die?
6	An animal had gnawed off its own foot to escape from a trap.
6	Perhaps this was the one step too far.
6	And to my surprise to my deep surprise, it's harder to say goodbye than I thought.
6	I'm shaky.
6	As for me, I'm just a slave.
6	There's no way I can have this kind of exposure.
6	I don't wanna kill you, Bell.
6	Please, give me another chance.
6	I only saw her when the family rented a farm in the summer.
6	No.
6	Well, I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow.
6	I really missed you.
6	All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that.
6	I feel like I messed it up.
6	We're in a war zone, Dave: Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire, the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate, heroic attempts.
6	You took him!
6	I just don't fit behind a desk, I I'm not cut out for it, I feel dry-docked.
6	This won't work.
6	She does though. Well, I should say my goodbyes.
6	What's the use of getting excited, Cluett?
6	The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.
6	I'm sorry.
6	Jealousy can be destructive.
6	Fuck! Fuck!
6	We'll say farewell to Cat Ballou
6	They don't know themselves.
6	Sweety, you're supposed to be beddy-byes!
6	No one else is heeding it.
6	Can't be done, not with this equipment.
6	I swear I didn't know.
6	Well, I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life, that I was an outsider.
6	Poor country! You sold the Piedmont in a senseless war.
6	All I got is what you see here.
6	I hate my life.
6	I'm sorry.
6	He died suddenly.
6	I killed her.
6	So when I see you having all these things that I didn't have, I, like, live through your eyes.
6	And none of us used to carry guns.
6	Doc, I don't want to fly any more.
6	That's when they start to drift away.
6	Even though we have each other. It can be a very lonely existence.
6	They gotta know Mario's gonna pull out their livers.
6	Fate and too many painkillers.
6	I don't know what's up, what shit you've been through to put you in that state.
6	I gave Barbara... Enough pain.
6	Goodbye, boys.
6	All I ever do is try to make you happy.
6	You think you should have done something different but it's not your fault that Erica died.
6	The bite... was mine.
6	I'm broke.
6	Will you tell me what awful thing I did to you when you were a child?
6	I'm very sorry about that, Miss...
6	No.
6	Child, crying:
6	If you don't eat and sleep, you have to expect accidents like that.
6	They said I was crazy, so they sent me to a mental hospital.
6	I never had the chance to apologize to her.
6	I never wrote it.
6	But it's sad.
6	I know, but it's too bad that wrestler Had to die for me to get it.
6	This is a house of ill fame, and I'm a fallen flower.
6	My wife, God rest her soul, died  years ago to the day.
6	Doctor, can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts?
6	It drags at your heart till... you can't do anything but look back.
6	As bad as it was having her missing, it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your -year-old child.
6	I think I care too much.
6	Not you. Not Agent Gibbs. Me.
6	All my powers have gone.
6	All that bread and livin' in a dump like this. Smashed cars, busted-out buses... but all good stashes.
6	And I don't want to....
6	He's dead, isn't he?
6	Maybe I wanted to see your face naked, no guard up, how you really felt hoping I would be wrong about something that I knew my entire life.
6	I'm going to jump.
6	How tragic.
6	Father Pearson told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself.
6	No, forget it.
6	You're getting heavier and heavier Can't carry you much longer
6	Nancy, please!
6	You know, I'm really worried about the kid.
6	It's fine, just a little pain.
6	The sword drew blood from the wounds and King Lindegast was saddened."
6	I couldn't do anything.
6	Poor boy who made it, ex-cop.
6	Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need.
6	Powell was a good man. Tough break.
6	A little poontang might ease your mind a bit.
6	I don't think we have anything for you.
6	He don't care about you and he don't care about me neither.
6	What he did was, he just took my money.
6	It takes away the pain.
6	You're just a product.
6	She was a prisoner as I was, and he just heard that she's dead.
6	For four years, and now it's over. For four years, I've invited the guests and bought the favors and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests.
6	Why I bother to look so good when there's no one here to admire the end product is beyond me. Know what I mean?
6	It's impossible. Chappie...
6	They all coldcocked me.
6	She'll never make another picture.
6	You and Oliver just weren't right for each other.
6	Hi. Come on, dad, let's play! Come on, dad, please, let's play.
6	Honey, I haven't had a chance to really talk to her...
6	Because of this attempted prison break, Beck would have to serve additional time.
6	We were all a part of what happened to her.
6	Please, don't let him do it!
6	I shall miss you too.
6	My back!
6	I'm sorry about your father.
6	Stop calling me, please.
6	I'm afraid it's all my fault.
6	I'm involved with someone else.
6	I'm an old man who will live until I die.
6	I shouldn't have hit Mel, shouldn't have picked up the telephone...
6	I was the opposite. I was angry.
6	She had been very abused.
6	And then this morning - I lost 'em. - We lost them.
6	It's too late to think of him.
6	Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess.
6	I'm sorry for you.
6	They are the tears of Old Russia.
6	I never see anything happen.
6	Just please help us.
6	It drags at your heart till... you can't do anything but look back.
6	No, nothing.
6	I'd only mess that up too.
6	When he held me, it wasn't the way a father should hold a daughter.
6	They'll never believe us.
6	That ain't gonna last forever.
6	Our dog died last night, too.
6	I was starting to miss the old Juliette, and now this has happened, and it just... It feels... it feels so final, you know?
6	And you've been resenting me.
6	I want to die.
6	There's too much loss of life and property damage possible.
6	What a waste of talent.
6	We must leave tonight.
6	We're all alone in this.
6	You don't think I can handle a twin engine at , feet, straight and level over some farm country? I mean, come on, sir.
6	Somethin' wrong with your car?
6	You're killing me.
6	I'm a sick man.
6	The ponies were dying.
6	Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough...
6	I've lost , pounds on the horses.
6	I thought I liked to party, but these guys...
6	We're here to talk about the online lucrative sale of America's children for sex, which in our experience occurs most prominently
6	Time drags when you're tired.
6	They changed it.
6	Juliette's dead.
6	Nothing. Nothing.
6	Phyllis can't ride on that thing, not in her condition.
6	Poor darling.
6	He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at.
6	And no one will believe me.
6	that are  years beyond what you could comprehend."
6	I wanted to apologize for the other night And I was wondering if I can have an opportunity To see you again today and--and just talk.
6	If Helen found out, it would kill her.
6	Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means that you have suffered damage to the brain.
6	I'm cold.
6	Then, one night, we were talking about how we hated the life, and how we had never done much of anything ourselves.
6	You gotta settle down or you're gonna wake him up.
6	I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
6	I've lied and used people all my life because I thought everybody did.
6	I tried my best to make a man out of him... but it look like I failed somewhere.
6	There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone. Look...
6	No.
6	Then, you'll want to say goodbye.
6	She's gone.
6	I'm sorry, Harvey.
6	Sorry I was suspicious.
6	She would be pained to hear you say that.
6	Barney, I am sorry.
6	Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless.
6	But that's another story, and a very unpleasant one, too.
6	And I'm tweaking. I'm outta money.
6	I have no idea what to do.
6	They screwed him up.
6	If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here.
6	The way you say that sounds so... rote.
6	Oh, God...
6	Mr. Levine knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question.
6	No, those were rumours.
6	I didn't mean to hurt you.
6	After all she done?
6	The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.
6	My Donald is dead.
6	I got too messed up 'bro.
6	It doesn't have to be like this.
6	Yeah, I'd like to burn it out of my mind.
6	Not even the pleasure of seeing you free... Can make up for this... This disgrace to the cause of justice.
6	Another funeral for the pilot, not as spiffy as Benti's.
6	It forces me to beg as a beggar.
6	You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here.
6	My sort of coming of age, which was hard...
6	With you guys it's always bad timing.
6	She'll never come back no more.
6	No more.
6	You hurt me. Yes.
6	If I spoke, you barely answered.
6	I'm sorry.
6	Please let me stay.
6	I've got bad news for you, GJ.
6	We're that kind of monster.
6	Skinny popped him.
6	Oh, you just left her?
6	One that will scream in the middle of the night and you'll have to stumble downstairs in the dark and change his soiled diapers.
6	Sorry, coach.
6	You must forgive me.
6	Okay, it was just a thought.
6	Hey, wasn't it gruesome, that girl who was shot in the street today?
6	Acknowledging defeat is never easy.
6	This is only the tip of the iceberg, as hundreds more have given us their testimony, but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families.
6	The helicopter crashed.
6	I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it.
6	There are estimates out there that . million homeless kids are out on the street at any given time.
6	Oh... okay, forget it.
6	No!
6	I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance.
6	No, Juliette.
6	You want to hurt me? You already did.
6	She doesn't care.
6	I'm sorry.
6	It does matter.
6	It wouldn't have worked.
6	Their privilege, their presumption.
6	I was in a really bad place.
6	l got lost.
6	Oh, I don't know.
6	Toad's friends tried to help him, but were always blocked.
6	I couldn't do anything.
6	I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle.
6	I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
6	I told you, you're probably overworking yourself.
6	No wonder he's worn out.
6	There's someone crying.
6	People used to stop on the street to admire me.
6	It makes my heart sad.
6	I was too late.
6	The doc just looked at us and shook his head.
6	I'm awfully sorry, darling.
6	Remember when Mick said when he was fighting sometimes, he'd fight so hard that he was thinking that he broke something inside?
6	Gentlemen, it is difficult to admit to an error.
6	No, I'm sorry, Mr. Slade.
6	It is not a pivotal project in your career.
6	That's just my nature.
6	I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am... That any of this has taken place.
6	But the magic was just draining out of him every time he got on that commuter train, back and forth from the suburbs every day.
6	He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.
6	I'm so sorry.
6	The worst would be a relief.
6	This time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if I must meet defeat.
6	Sorry, Padre.
6	Satan's spirit flew right out of my TV set And into my soul.
6	I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail.
6	I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.
6	The most horrible thing was, you'd smile when you were mad.
6	They probably will start crying.
6	Then there's no hope.
6	Seems a shame to part company after all these years.
6	That's what always happens when people fall in love.
6	Please don't cry anymore.
6	You poor child.
6	So he never saw her again?
6	No one can help me.
6	Then, you'll want to say goodbye.
6	To the squad. Are they detaining it, it is?
6	You're making me look bad.
6	Is he dead?
6	But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time.
6	They're gonna keep him in that foster home!
6	I was almost in tears.
6	Very well. I understand, doctor.
6	Poor boy.
6	I'll have to write it all over again.
6	I guess we're all trying to prove something to ourselves.
6	A man is going to die.
6	Sorry, sister.
6	You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
6	How can you forget yourselves this way?
6	There are many who cannot tell between good and evil
6	I'll be fine.
6	Yeah, ever since, uh, Brian joined the firm, he's been trying to marry me off.
6	They didn't miss me at all.
6	You're fired, Jeffries.
6	Sounds tough.
6	Too many passengers, I'm afraid.
6	I'm not ready to retire yet.
6	Fifty of them froze to death in one night.
6	Lincoln just ain't the same no more.
6	What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life.
6	George Brewster says he didn't rent a car. The rental company says he did. Whatever.
6	They'd go to Congress and get more funding.
6	I... I can't.
6	You look like death.
6	Besides, this desert climate's not too good on a girl's complexion.
6	From then on I was hopelessly lost.
6	Let me me go somewhere else. I'm sick.
6	Well, you know what I think? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong.
6	But I shouldn't have left like that. I'm sorry.
6	And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown.
6	And then, of course, there was the unexpected and, I must say, regrettable suicide of George Brewster.
6	It's pretty rough.
6	I'll make amends.
6	As long as you're here, let me show you the books... so you can see how bad a businessman I am.
6	I can't believe I threw up in front of Dean Wormer.
6	Nothing ever happens.
6	Well, no wonder you're worn out.
6	I have to live every single day of my life now with everything that's happened to me.
6	We've lost the baby's heartbeat.
6	Louis, I don't want to hear it.
6	Those were the last words she heard me say.
6	We're all gonna die.
6	Hey, you told me the only way you survive is because you're a team.
6	I didn't want to hear about the war.
6	Okay, I'm sorry, all right?
6	I'm just an old farm boy.
6	So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet.
6	Not even a perhaps or a maybe?
6	Not to come to America, at least not for a while.
6	George, there's no point in going on.
6	Because when you talked about murder on the tapes... I assumed it was just hallucination.
6	You don't care whether I live or die.
6	Opening night never starts on time.
6	Yeah, my veneer popped off, yeah sucks.
6	An evil spirit took by corpse and won't let me rest in peace
6	Only when the weapons were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were.
6	It was damn stupid of me, wasn't it?
6	It's over.
6	Bloomy, were you asleep?
6	But I want to be alone.
6	What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so.
6	I try to help, but he doesn't listen to me, and I've got my own grief to work through.
6	I want to go to fashion school.
6	Is it that you think it'll be better for... for all of us if you go away?
6	Wasn't it hard to... To live with yourself After completely wimping out
6	The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas.
6	I wanted to save the ship.
6	You don't care about me.
6	You were terribly in love with her.
6	Why is she crying?
6	I was not a good artist.
6	I really belong in jail.
6	It was terrible. He screamed with fear.
6	Willy, don't look so unhappy.
6	I can't handle basic training again, man.
6	Is not no one, who could take care of him?
6	Stop, wait!
6	I'll never see you again.
6	Schizo, I wanted to meet him...
6	In the end, we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet.
6	Why are you crying, Mistress Margaret?
6	Imagine, an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
6	I will. This isn't exactly comfortable for me. I know you wanted this job.
6	I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.
6	Because it seems so hopeless, is that it?
6	I had got addicted to watching porn.
6	Afraid not.  dollars, please.
6	You're just being used, you know.
6	She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
6	For me, the fun went out of it after Wendy died. It was never any good, really, after that.
6	It's impossible. Now time is up, New York's doing it's audit.
6	Please just look at me.
6	That'll clip your wings.
6	You knew how I felt.
6	I'm sorry.
6	I wasn't looking where I was going.
6	I was a child.
6	That will be the toughest part.
6	The phone is dead.
6	Oh, Vinnie, no.
6	My new car!
6	Because it seems so hopeless, is that it?
6	One of my biggest disappointments over the last  years is those who lack the courage of their convictions.
6	I don't believe you.
6	He probably doesn't remember me.
6	I can't go to the grand jury without him.
6	I don't know about you guys... but I gotta get outta here.
6	I can't help myself.
6	All I heard was trash talk.
6	I don't dance well.
6	I don't want to go to Siberia.
6	He'll never get started.
6	I have to work.
6	How did we end up talking about your death from my drug test? I don't understand.
6	I know I'm being disrespectful to this honourable body...
6	There's more bad?
6	I thought I was the best stud-poker player in the world.
6	I'm sorry I snapped at you.
6	He wouldn't have, unless he were discouraged and angry.
6	Ah, ah, I'm so sorry. Christine has nothing to do with this.
6	Why won't you let me help you?
6	Yeah, he was a good soldier.
6	He was gonna die?
6	And isaac started flying up To the sad broken star.
6	They're all dead.
7	And were you not told the same thing by his wife?
7	What sort of a man are you?
7	Oh, he ain't alone.
7	Don't I know you?
7	Not Sergei?
7	Look, you can't dwell on what you hoped was gonna happen with Diana.
7	Everybody else thought it was funny!
7	When did you get a chance to do this, kid?
7	Why are you asking me all these questions?
7	That's right! Fantastic!
7	Are you sure this report's correct?
7	Oh, you understand the occult!
7	My god, I am still in love you.
7	It's me, Vinnie.
7	Who is she?
7	So that you could tell me this?
7	Your chest again.
7	You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
7	Says who?
7	The boy won't give me the eagle.
7	Christ, he's been stripped.
7	Don't you like children?
7	What makes you think there's something the matter with her?
7	Hey, what the fuck?
7	What are those lights?
7	Why did you shoot him?
7	He might even be expecting you.
7	Oh! Sorry. You made me jump.
7	I just didn't believe it.
7	Why do you want to make yourself a slave to this dull business, when you could be on a lovely yacht, with a lovely man, visiting the Greek islands, seeing all the world?
7	I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan.
7	Thank you. I am still curious
7	I want one! Cuts along on a jolly clip too, doesn't she?
7	He seems to know everything else.
7	That name's kinda familiar, ain't it, Mink?
7	Where are the females?
7	Seems much slower than the other eight times I've seen it.
7	I never thought of it...
7	But it was that that looked.
7	Herb?
7	Don't you want to go to New York?
7	Hmm, it was rather sweet.
7	I didn't expect you to.
7	What's going on?
7	Oh tots, I'll keep that in mind.
7	What the hell are we doing out here?
7	It was fine. You've been away all this time?
7	Brian?
7	But everyone pretended he could walk?
7	You want me to go in there? 
7	There they are, they must have found her!
7	It's a miracle.
7	Are you trying to tell me that you want to be on television?
7	Oh, no, no, no.
7	I forgot who I was.
7	Are you crazy?
7	You've always had to work?
7	Christ!
7	That was my girl. Wait.
7	But they were lights, they were flying around.
7	I thought you were getting fatter, Mama!
7	This? Do you know what this is?
7	The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it. My brother, Orville, told me all about you.
7	Yeah, right.
7	Hey, Cain!
7	Are you okay?
7	Here on holiday but seems to be having a bit of car trouble?
7	Something's happened to the dog.
7	Looks like he's in great shape, don't he?
7	There are you, free to come and go as you please, and you choose to stay here.
7	God, you're the one who kidnapped him.
7	Cause we just got a package, and I don't see his address here in the...
7	Hi, Uncle Paulie.
7	Sweetheart, what are you doing home?
7	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
7	I love this car.
7	Does not this makes you laugh?
7	Oh, Vinnie, no.
7	He acted strange.
7	You ?
7	Who ordered this? - The gentleman did.
7	This witness will testify about a bar glass. They have no bar glass.
7	That's the biggest pot yet.
7	It wasn't even loaded.
7	Don't you think I know how you plan to get out?
7	That's not bad for a blind man.
7	You know. sometimes it feels like it's the only thing keeping us together.
7	I don't want to hear this!
7	Is there anybody here?
7	Where's Julio's old lady, man?,
7	But what's she doing off of Bermuda with part of that fleet's treasure?
7	Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
7	An... an accident? Easy, Joe, easy. Watch the rug.
7	He's getting married in  minutes.
7	Jorgensen...?
7	That's fabulous, really.
7	Madame, if you don't think about food, what do you think about?
7	Can we even do this?
7	He's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm.
7	I refuse to answer that question.
7	Any guy who says he can fence $50,000,is crazy.
7	How could he, A young, inexperienced priest, Do battle alone with the dark lord himself?
7	How did you get in here?
7	Fuck, he's not dead!
7	l pumped your stomach. Oh, God.
7	Who's askin' to see me?
7	Is that what you wanted?
7	I've looked all over for shoes like that.
7	He spent money on a bible?
7	Did you think I was a lady?
7	Why did the inspector allow me to say all those things?
7	You one of them rare youths, yeah?
7	Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
7	Is that true?
7	Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
7	I wouldn't think of such a thing!
7	Oh my God.
7	I don't know what you're talking about.
7	What a man!
7	Good we're not broke, or we'd really be miserable.
7	It's just beginner's luck.
7	My brother took all your cigarettes? I have another pack.
7	Is that what this is?
7	I'll listen, but I can't guarantee how long.
7	Are you coming with me?
7	He didn't like it.
7	It's getting real bright out here.
7	Jesus, I wondered who ate these damn things.
7	But if Eben's an angel, why ain't he in Heaven?
7	My, and you did your spring house-cleaning all in one day.
7	I thought he was kidding.
7	Why?
7	I had trouble getting back to the sub.
7	You didn't think I was dead, too, did you? Maria.
7	I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
7	Hey, it's me!
7	I never know in advance when I'm going to be a genius.
7	I didn't know you were still here.
7	I'm pregnant, you know.
7	But the windows will?
7	You won't stand for it?
7	Why can't I say it?
7	I thought you was dead.
7	Wait a minute. While you had what's-her-name sitting on your face...
7	Ha ha!
7	So, I heard you we're going to propose to Brandi Svenning in some theme park.
7	And then one day I went into the barn... and there he was.
7	Why didn't you think of that?
7	They are wise, these old women!
7	Holy Moses.
7	Why aren't they telling us anything?
7	The dog grabs the gorilla and swings what?
7	How is that any different?
7	How did Prager and the newspapers get the Joeppli story before you?
7	I don't see any native girls hungry for affection.
7	I don't understand. You're already married.
7	Don't move!
7	You took him!
7	Why are you saying these things?
7	British Intelligence showed you the letter for the first time in Lisbon?
7	Compliments of the gent in the corner by the door.
7	And you believe that?
7	I understand! You're provoking me into hitting you
7	Talk what things over?
7	I thought you'd be onto me if anyone was. ""
7	What are you doing with this guy?
7	Who let you in?
7	He can't get a clear shot!
7	I have been thinking about you. Really?
7	That's strange, my brother can't drive like that.
7	Well, look who's here.
7	I thought you said she got on the helicopter.
7	It must have been here all day.
7	I turned pro at  and I had eight fights.
7	I thought you'd be old.
7	Really?
7	That's not judge Judy.
7	What's he saying? -He says he's an Egyptian sailor.
7	I've seen him!
7	Nick! What the--?
7	You can do this?
7	You said she was coming with us.
7	The defence has an interesting point.
7	What's his name again?
7	Even God wouldn't believe it!
7	Why is he driving?
7	That's odd.
7	Oh!
7	I don't believe you.
7	All that gossip!
7	Witness interviews?
7	Tell me, what keeps you from burning out?
7	What the...
7	Are you looking for somebody?
7	What the hell are you talking about? We had drinks last night.
7	How come she leave that job?
7	Did you do it?
7	Hey. What the hell was that?
7	He's alive!
7	Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?
7	You did not bore me.
7	You don't believe that stuff, do you?
7	Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news.
7	What's the great rush?
7	What's weak about wanting?
7	Why should that worry you?
7	Not like a scientist, like an... artist.
7	Playing with amateurs, huh?
7	Eighteen years on the force, six on Narcotics, four on Safe and Loft and the guy's never fired a gun.
7	Sister Inviolata, you play great game of balls. How come?
7	Where are you going?
7	It's a new car.
7	That's incredible.
7	You were supposed to come Tuesday.
7	What's with those cicadas anyway?
7	You two know each other?
7	I don't know how I got home that night. The most difficult part was trying to... act normal when I paid off the babysitter.
7	Don't nobody want to ask me nothin'?
7	That's me! Junior!
7	That to marry Maria would be the most senselessly cruel and destructive thing you will ever have done?
7	Now that hurts. Because this was my intention from the very beginning.
7	Yesterday they didn't even have a kid and now they have a seven-year-old.
7	What happened? Where are the others?
7	What's the matter, kids?
7	You are here looking for a friend?
7	I can't believe this. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper.
7	My word, are there important people downstairs?
7	What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
7	Holy shit.
7	What about staying alive!
7	You disapprove, sir?
7	The things are walking fast, my friend. Perhaps fast too much.
7	I don't get your generation's humour.
7	They're real, aren't they?
7	But Jordan told me she was with you.
7	Strange men, you mean?
7	The best, smartest, most interesting women in the world?
7	What's it like...?
7	What the hell's going on here?
7	It's her!
7	What's the idea of turning her down?
7	Wow. - I missed that one.
7	You didn't put anything for job history.
7	This is a surprise.
7	What precinct, sir?
7	That means he's flying it.
7	ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA.
7	What are you doing with my uncle's briefcase?
7	That's true.
7	Haven't seen you here before.
7	Why, you don't have to hide.
7	The dove was a ghost?
7	This is the bridal suite?
7	It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200,years.
7	You can't go down there!
7	What else do you have to tell?
7	So, you're a lawyer now?
7	What happened?
7	Somethin' wrong with your car?
7	You gotta fix this mess, be it how you fix it with your girl, or how you fix it with Jake, cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this.
7	What are you afraid of?
7	It's been... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work.
7	So that's what those things are for.
7	What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them?
7	That was close, mate.
7	You protect a fruit stand, man, a shoeshine parlor, you know?
7	You can still climb in that kiddie car and take a hike... unless you can fight better than you can drive!
7	Hey! I can't believe you got here!
7	To read something like that was, frankly, it was alarming to me.
7	Why don't you fire her?
7	I thought he was sick.
7	Oh, it was just...
7	I haven't been up this early in years.
7	Where's your uniform?
7	There could have been better answers to some of the questions.
7	This material doesn't correspond to anything on the periodic table.
7	Don't I know you?
7	They're unbelievable.
7	Why isn't he at his desk?
7	Is this the time, or I am blind?
7	Would you have preferred the Verua kill me?
7	They don't know themselves.
7	Will you please tell me how you knew that?
7	What, it's over?
7	That was close.
7	You saw that coming, did you?
7	Stop the presses!
7	What are you talking about, dad,
7	See what you can do? You weren't even conscious then, for chrissake.
7	You really could be a nun! Thanks.
7	What!
7	Why Rivoli?
7	Yes?
7	There's no change in it, is there?
7	Abracadabra!
7	How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
7	I might do that.
7	Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee.
7	Boy, you got hands of gold.
7	* Uh-oh uh-oh... Why did you take down the Lisbon Lace number?
7	Do I look like a baroness?
7	Autumn?
7	That's the boy wonder?
7	What are you doing in here?
7	What happened?
7	We lost Ben!
7	Half of Wolf City's on the way up here.
7	Where did you get this?
7	Cooper, no!
7	Matt, you must be mistaken.
7	Don't you look good.
7	There is something strange about that boy!
7	This is the largest police car I've ever seen.
7	You're light again, George.
7	And this spic, Valentin, what a fucking nut case.
7	So you fell in love with him.
7	Alex, don't you remember?
7	I mean, if our system wasn't any good, why did they take us over in the first place, right?
7	You understand?
7	When did you get back?
7	Mrs Devaney, do you know what you just ordered?
7	My new car!
7	She's not taking that.
7	So, a rose is not a rose, and an umbrella has nothing to do with rain.
7	That's all?
7	When? - Call came in last night.
7	Pure acid!
7	Are you crazy?
7	Should we call him?
7	What a surprise to see you.
7	Disappointing.
7	But there's no dirt in here. - I know.
7	Yeah, and in this heat... I mean, BO and barbecue!
7	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I sit up and wonder where I am.
7	I don't believe it! He was down and out and finished!
7	Yeah, I knew it! He said it's only a guess! I still say it's p.M.S.
7	Come on, up and over!
7	Hey!
7	What in the hell are you doing here at this hour of the morning?
7	Something about your mother.
7	That's some ride, huh?
7	Wouldn't they have done it anyway?
7	How about that? Not bad.
7	But are they telling me, or are they asking me?
7	She plans her suicide.
7	Now let him win it back!
7	I didn't mean to scare you.
7	She figured out where the kids are being held, and she wants us to go rescue them.
7	You love her or what?
7	Gus, I thought you were going to attend to that later.
7	Yo, Tommy!
7	That's what comes of teaching science by TV.
7	You don't like what you're doing?
7	You think so?
7	I don't think I've seen you before.
7	It isn't that. It's what Pete said.
7	That's not competitive. That's ambition and talent.
7	Aren't you gonna tell me my sins are forgiven?
7	I thought that was you.
7	You intend to take it yourself?
7	You tryin' to adopt a kid?
7	What's up with you people and that watermelon?
7	You really should be AM and FM...
7	Why's she making those funny noises?
7	Push! Here it is! Here it is!
7	They sent you. - What?
7	It was no self-defense, Brennan took him out.
7	If this guy has any information, why hasn't he contacted you already?
7	How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?
7	Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
7	Miss what?
7	Never, not even for a minute, I believed that you had been.
7	No, please, no!
7	You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
7	What? What, daddy?
7	Is he gonna be a problem?
7	Oh, just things that little girls dream about.
7	Incredible!
7	Now he was going to pry it open.
7	This kid's taking this too good.
7	Why is there a statue of a husky?
7	Many of you aren't wearing battle gear.
7	Oh, it's swell!
7	What do you mean by that?
7	The general talked about killing the president.
7	Oh, no! - Oh, yes!
7	Was that you?
7	There it is.
7	You know too much.
7	They told me you wouldn't see me.
7	No...
7	What are you doing, making a career out of this?
7	They just all happened to be in the same place...
7	I hope you like clowns.
7	At the moment, you have an excellent chance of being hanged.
7	Oh, fuck!
7	Tommy, why did you bring him here?
7	But I think you'll enjoy his game.
7	Where've you been?
7	We're onto something.
7	Hey, look at this, guys.
7	Brings out the best in you, Melba.
7	Look, money!
7	No diaphragm in that lady. What happened to it?
7	You spent $, at The Capital Grille?
7	What are they doing here?
7	Then again, you never can tell.
7	Mr. Ackerman? It's been so long. I almost didn't recognize you.
7	You forgot your shoes.
7	A few years ago, you was a truck driver.
7	Then, suddenly, I vomited on my family. Hmm.
7	How come?
7	This is absurd.
7	Is that what you're worried about?
7	Young lady, would you pull down your dress? Sure.
7	Aren't you tired, Melanie?
7	Very nice of him, though.
7	A cook?
7	Do not you know?
7	For me?
7	Like one time, I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked, except he still had his socks on.
7	What about the treasure?
7	You admire the son of a bitch.
7	Their privilege, their presumption.
7	Just because it is big and white and a yacht, is it not still dirt?
7	Painter?
7	Why are you laughing?
7	Where'd they go?
7	Magic?
7	We're being attacked!
7	Not even a perhaps or a maybe?
7	Sweety, you're supposed to be beddy-byes!
7	Oh, God, it even has a barn.
7	I...didn't think I'd ever see you again.
7	I want to go to fashion school.
7	Were you alone? - Yes.
7	You could love me?
7	No! No!
7	It's portable, long-range, very expensive.
7	You hadn't seen him in years, and yet you say he was an old friend.
7	You won't believe it until you see it.
7	That monster is so tall, it'll see us if he stands up straight
7	Look at you, baby girl! Hey, you ready to blow this joint or what?
7	Sophia?
7	He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at.
7	Riley! We're family!
7	This one is getting too popular.
7	Leon, why are you so good to us?
7	Hundred dollars a night?
7	You won't stand for it?
7	You shot Mr. McGruder!
7	That's not unusual.
7	You know what?
7	or something? - Fuck! - Graham.
7	Ah, yes! 'I had a migraine, your Majesty.
7	This is one sophisticated operation.
7	This is like the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life. - It makes it yummy.
7	Anyway you can't go to the hospital.
7	You know, you remind me more and more of my first husband.
7	He was here two weeks before I knew he'd moved in.
7	We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last  years, more than  planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support
7	You mean you're through with the case?
7	There is an American on board.
7	The Enquirer. The Star. Variety.
7	I'm surprised at you!
7	How?
7	Did Lewis really play here?
7	Oh, Sorry Ringo.
7	But where have I put it?
7	How great can you kiss?
7	What's what like?
7	How are we to answer this, Rusty Sabich and I?
7	What are you talking about?
7	But who would buy the boat?
7	Ka-rumph! We were smashed to port.
7	You go expecting these things to happen and they do.
7	Oh, professor... just a moment.
7	Valerie has a terrific body.
7	Now's not a good time.
7	Oh, you got me. - That better?
7	What kind? The ones in bottles.
7	Why aren't they firing?
7	They told me you had a wine cellar, but I didn't believe it.
7	Why Charles, what are you doing here?
7	I am not your horse.
7	This doesn't make sense.
7	Who in the world can do that?
7	Funny, he never told me his name.
7	Tell me what Carolyn Polhemus was doing with a bribery file.
7	Oh, no, no, no. I want to hear more about this.
7	I'm Ensign Torrey, sir.
7	Boone?
7	And you found out?
7	Frank, you're free!
7	In other words, you don't know?
7	Our agenda"?"
7	Oh, did I? Uh, I am.
7	My God.
7	I thought you wouldn't see Eddington now you're back with Jere.
7	Would you really wear a thing like that?
7	That was some road trip.
7	And did you believe this nonsense?
7	You've made no protests yourself?
7	Siegfried dealt the king a mortal blow.
7	And you shouldn't neglect your gums.
7	Come on, you're kidding me, right?
7	Well, we won't tell anybody about that, okay?
7	What'd you just say?
7	Make your wish.
7	No!
7	Oh, my god! What are you doing?
7	Let's just time Lancelot as he comes charging to the rescue! - What's going on here?
7	You steal a little swordfish, and Hannah should lighten up?
7	He got kicked upstairs.
7	What was what?
7	Barley?
7	That is outrageous.
7	Young man, you think this thing won't fly?
7	I don't think we have anything for you.
7	What are you doing?
7	Is he okay with that?
7	Oh, know how to count!
7	You're telling me you are married? Yeah!
7	I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing.
7	Must have been watching out that window for hours.
7	Incredible.
7	It's Louie! Louie Vinchenzi from San Francisco.
7	It's more than my job's worth!
7	What are you doing?
7	Oh! I go there quite often.
7	So that's what you came to see me about?
7	That's when they come. That's why they're called surprises.
7	Unless he's looking for something else.
7	How come I never see you eating?
7	Where's that wonderful music coming from?
7	You got our package back, man.
7	Oh, you just left her?
7	You look different.
7	Maria, nice to meet you.
7	How did this happen?
7	Hurry!
7	What happened to your coat?
7	What are you afraid of?
7	What do you mean, call?
7	Oh, no?
7	We thought Monsignor Fitzgerald will take over the building fund.
7	Carolyn would've fought back.
7	God, this is a list of questions that could unlock all the Sov military secrets and win the arms race at a stroke:
7	Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords?
7	That's a weapon in your world?
7	Strelnikov is dead. - What?
7	Is it really him?
7	I appreciate your patience.
7	There may be subs out there, maybe not.
7	No, not perhaps"."
7	If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home.
7	Where'd this come from?
7	Good heavens, these Russian names.
7	Oh!
7	I've been called a lot of things, but "comfortable"!
7	What a comeback, Jesse ventura!
7	For Christ's sake!
7	That's why I couldn't remember anything on Saturday.
7	Where is everybody?
7	Watch out, you idiot!
7	Sure I do.
7	Why am I here?
7	Why should today be any different, you know what I mean?
7	Tonight? No, no. No feathers.
7	Did I hear Lieutenant Junior Grade"?"
7	Kelly's dead?
7	Maybe it's me and Fornell.
7	Oh, my God, no, I can't be bleeding again.
7	This is quite a pleasant surprise.
7	How can he see pink? It's a black and white picture.
7	Jesus Christ, what happened?
7	Spare some change? No.
7	What, somebody had a saxophone?
7	Well, actually...
7	!
7	All the officers were disloyal.
7	All that money, Baron?
7	It's a whole new deal.
7	Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
7	Yes, Commissioner.
7	Did Captain Queeg look sick?
7	You spoke for him.
7	What are they doing here?
7	Oh, my!
7	Spoil what?
7	Oh, here you are...
7	Wait a minute now.
7	Watch out!
7	Chappie, it's me. - Yeah.
7	You've always had to work?
7	What the hell does" it purport to describe?"
7	I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
7	So, what can I do for you?
7	Dear Mr. Horgan." "This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes.""
7	I thought politics interested you.
7	Don't tell me you've left it up there.
7	It's impossible!
7	What do you have? What are you hiding?
7	A good thing my reactions are so fast
7	That surprises me even more.
7	Like Clyde lost control?
7	A hundred thousand dollars?
7	You didn't know that about Angela, eh?
7	Hey, Captain. Captain, we left a treasure out there...
7	Theoretically, it should have a much greater effect.
7	Arthur?
7	Jesus christ, man.
7	Condition Zebra alert.""
7	A dead animal!
7	For you to become a murderer?
7	You all right?
7	Who said I'm moving?
7	I'd offer you something harder, but you don't drink?
7	There are you, free to come and go as you please, and you choose to stay here.
7	He said he forgot.
7	No, nothing.
7	You named it.
7	So you just hang out and keep a look at kids?
7	Aw. What happened?
7	Pardon me, are you an explorer?
7	Jane could be killed.
7	But what's wrong with Sister Marian's habit?
7	And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
7	You've gone too far!
7	You're happy all the time?
7	We found his badge.
7	Was it you?
7	Oh, please send her in.
7	I understand perfectly.
7	You want us to believe that?
7	That's a lot of love, to give up the money he's making.
7	Understand? What?
7	We're getting a lot of heat from parents' groups.
7	Wait till somebody gets killed?
7	Hadn't they promised to keep our name out of it?
7	Wait a minute!
7	Yep, glad to hear... see you like music, too?
7	Vinnie!
7	Why did they pull out?
7	But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy.
7	That's why you brought me here?
7	I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
7	It's like they're running an errand, and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand.
7	Oh, God...
7	You could tell just by looking at him that half the time he didn't know where he was.
7	No! What do the nuns do anyway?
7	I didn't know we were on a first-name basis, but how are you?
7	I should be back in Hollywood, sitting in front of a typewriter, making all this up for a movie.
7	Say, wait a minute.
7	Running around in that eye paint ain't gonna get you nowhere, boy.
7	So that's where the old raunch kept his stash!
7	Caught in the act.
7	You won't believe this.
7	Well, haven't you seen the paper?
7	I'm actually beginning to like them.
7	Boy, I don't know how you survived in this world up to now.
7	We must act immediately, tonight!
7	Why did you do it, Andy?
7	Oh, this is so cool!
7	Isn't that what we planned for six months in your bedroom?
7	Ringo!"
7	You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
7	This one's on the house. - Thanks, but...
7	Hundreds!
7	Thank goodness you're all right.
7	So you're Manderson.
7	You know, we knew you was a punk then, but you're being a punk now.
7	What do you mean, there's no more money?
7	Well, that's a lot of them. Whoa.
7	Why have you been carrying the bags with you all the time?
7	By most standards, flying all the way to Madrid to look for a new face would seem like going to a lot of trouble.
7	Wait for me!
7	You mean, he has a key to your home?
7	Do you know that my first trip to California took five days?
7	You're saying that someone made it look as if it had been forced from the outside?
7	That's odd.
7	No, no, they don't.
7	The bus, the bus!
7	You know when I realized that?
7	We weren't expecting you for a while yet.
7	That's very rare.
7	Who's that?
7	You have a resemblance to him.
7	She flipped and tried to kill herself.
7	What are you doing here, Decker?
7	That huge place over there?
7	You sound like a woman with a mission. I am.
7	She's getting outta range!
7	You place an absurd value On the cheapest of human commodities.
7	Ripping out phones, urinating on desks.
7	Shit.
7	How are you going to sing?
7	Well, I don't think I can do much, sir, but...
7	Anyway, last year he comes to me. He wants some names checked out. Who was where, who's doing what.
7	Wouldn't this be faster?
7	We lost Ben, go back!
7	Can you ever imagine Kirk being in a spot like that?
7	How do you know how to do all of this?
7	What are you talking about?
7	It's a little foggy that you're pissed about 'cause I thought--´
7	You get off wearing women's clothing?
7	Yeah, and I wish I could keep it!
7	Why would he buy a bible?
7	Garter belt?
7	They laugh and kiss, then they scream and beat each other.
7	But you are absolutely sure he was a priest?
7	And just how did he go about that?
7	What would you do if it was your child?
7	Would you like me to go back and get Kenneth out?
7	Come on, Bob. You can't have them.
7	What are you talking about?
7	That surprises me.
7	Since you're sitting in the corner. You're usually a power table kind of girl.
7	Are you serious?
7	Which items?
7	You're wanted in Plot.
7	Your mommy took you to the hospital because you were hurt.
7	Maybe I should just go back to the clinic?
7	It's hard to believe, isn't it?
7	Well, that wasn't very nice.
7	Why are you so good to us?
7	You're meaning' the monster, ain't ya, mate?
7	He tried to limit the scope of the fingerprint search to exclude his own.
7	You'd think they'd let a man keep his hair.
7	Ass cam. - What?
7	So, how is it you know so little about cars?
7	And just what exactly are your intentions, young man?
7	We can still make it.
7	I rehearse my story. I try to think of all the questions they'll ask.
7	Very interesting. They give a good dental plan to you?
7	You've come home.
7	Senator Paine decided this with you?
7	Ah, the ring!
7	How did we ever stand each other in that plane for three years during the war?
7	What are you talking about? She doesn't have a twin sister.
7	The creatures were about uh, four foot.
7	So the police are extended giving the famous protection, for which we are justly proud in this country, for a finger, eh?
7	Shit!
7	What's the occasion?
7	You must have a strong stomach to want to see that sort of thing.
7	You didn't tell us?
7	You mean I'm supposed to take mama's place?
7	The drinking, the drugs, that's not a regular thing for me.
7	You mean Jesse was here?
7	The good news is Kid here has agreed to sponsor you as a Prospect.
7	Saint Deus. What she said?
7	Wait a minute, I'm ahead of you.
7	The best! - Mr. Poirot!
7	You were told about the vortex?
7	We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind.
7	It still has the keys, Mr. Poirot? - Oui.
7	No DNA found at the scene.
7	Beauty! Look at that.
7	Now's your chance, go!
7	You don't often see a set of charlies that nice.
7	She's in labor now?
7	You wrote me letters?
7	Well, I never thought I'd spend my wedding night with you, Kate.
7	You see that man giving screwface to Jake?
7	Nice entrance.
7	I can't remember. - You can't remember?
7	Apparently Evelyn smells like Catalina too.
7	The back door!
7	Quite an act.
7	Yes, I'm afraid I was misquoted.
7	Oh, you have tobacco!
7	What made you think you could get in?
7	Captain, there's a few bodies up there.
7	You don't remember, do you?
7	They told me you had a wine cellar, but I didn't believe it.
7	I don't have casual affairs.
7	Ugh! Shocking!
7	So you do not recognize me?
7	Darling, why weren't you disappointed?
7	But how do you live there all by yourself?
7	You're a detective now?
7	Do I actually see this?
7	You must love that guy to do what you did for him.
7	You knew that too?
7	This is maybe the most important case that we handle in our legal career.
7	Gonna die!
7	It's the first time he's told me the truth!
7	Anyway, what's it matter to you?
7	Did you see what he did?
7	How come we're just getting it?
7	Marty Weiner has disappeared.
7	You mean you're trading in your horse for a wagon ride?
7	And you're amazing and this would be amazing.
7	What the hell is that?
7	What if Case tortures her?
7	We can't. We were never together.
7	We did not ditch. We were working.
7	This is a surprise.
7	Defend yourselves!
7	We never had a nursery, Marlowe.
7	What are you doin' here?
7	He didn't sleep.
7	Tommy Gunn!
7	One man muzzling a whole state?
7	Excuse me, sir. What about your meal?
7	What the hell?
7	( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind?
7	Never saw a man yet could hold his liquor like a bottle.
7	You found her.
7	Yeah, you might say that.
7	And you know what? They offered us a job.
7	Frankly, I don't recall a time when a witness has refused to testify in this fashion.
7	You have a lot of faith in us!
7	You didn't get legal advice?
7	Oh, don't say that!
7	How the hell do you know where we are?
7	Hey, hey, hey! Where does it say
7	You're really the tolerant type, Cavanaugh!
7	Yes. Yes. Plays cards like an English officer and a gentleman.
7	Brian was right. You are lovely.
7	100% truthful, Ace? - Yeah.
7	But..
7	Would you really wear a thing like that?
7	We lost them! I think we lost them! -Thank God!
7	Where is Cain? !
7	Don't you consider this a public responsibility to respond now?
7	That was stupid and cruel.
7	My prince, did I hear you right?
7	Are you guys brothers!
7	Silly, it never occurred to me.
7	But there's no support for this appealing idea.
7	What in the world is all this?
7	This is an unscheduled surprise.
7	That's some sign you got on the door out there.
7	and you will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space.""
7	A... pointless award?
7	Well, there it is.
7	You gave $50,for this horse?
7	The Belgian of the village?
7	Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself standing here with you tonight.
7	That!
7	The monster?
7	The killer! - There's no killer here.
7	Barnaby, all of this is very confusing.
7	The man is an animal.
7	Who-Who? Who's sick?
7	That son of a bitch is getting away with it.
7	Actually, we don't know a soul here.
7	She gave you that?
7	Sarkozy.
7	Hey, look who's here!
7	Usually, I just reach out my hand, and obstacles disappear.
7	Bullshit.
7	You look pretty good up there yourself.
7	Behold the Santa for all seasons!
7	Can you imagine that guy?
7	What the fuck did you do, man?
7	Hey, what the hell are you going to Frenchy movies for, anyway?
7	We were licked, weren't we?
7	Case is here!
7	At , she was so pretty.
7	You sober right now? Uh-huh. Eight months.
7	Don't you find that restful?
7	Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time?
7	You're not even real ghosts!
7	We wound up on a train. - A train?
7	What's going on?
7	You're not going to marry him?
7	No.
7	You've got a beard! You're a man!
7	You're still dressed?
7	Are we killers now?
7	Matt, you must be mistaken.
7	Whereas when you scratch the apprentice kid,
7	Now you want to give him another?
7	It's all here.
7	So it really is the same old Sparky that we all knew and loved.
7	Ow! Don't run in the hallways!
7	Wait a minute, how much is this?
7	We ain't hungry... not food hungry anyway.
7	So, you guys are mounties?
7	And it's a miracle old Billy's alive today.
7	You sure?
7	And I was with some boys in the neighborhood, and we saw this and went, "Oh, My God!"
7	You dreamt I lost some weight?
7	Ah... I see it pays to advertise on television.
7	Those bathing beauties you've been watching haven't raised your temperature one degree in a month.
7	The Nancy!
7	What are you talkin' about?
7	Are you out of your mind?
7	Here's you all playing rooster with it!
7	You made me remember things that I had forgotten.
7	The day before she did that terrible thing to me.
7	All of you!
7	Bad guys! Alley!
7	Oh, I almost forgot.
7	Profess--
7	What were they counting on?
7	What did he bring his pigeons for?
7	Does this mean Tommy and Miss Balbricker are engaged?
7	You couldn't leave your girl?
7	Oh, what are you doing here?
7	Why you drinkin' that cold coffee?
7	You all right?
7	What about dynamite?
7	The tree is alive?
7	You don't seem the least bit worried about the pending charges against your secretary.
7	Only I didn't create 'em, I heard about 'em from other people.
7	Okay, good luck I guess!
7	What happened?
7	Hey, that's it.
7	We're not going to plant anything, if that's what you're worried about.
7	Yeah, I um, I just... just thought I saw something, but I can't really, um, trust my eyes these days.
7	Bad guy.
7	The State offers as evidence... From the defendant's suitcoat... A hair identified by the Police Crime Lab as that of the deceased.
7	Hey!
7	We miss one payment, and you can foreclose?
7	What's going on?
7	I swear I didn't know.
7	The three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.""
7	They haven't even been touched!
7	I couId vomit.
7	Underwater?
7	Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?
7	You lost your ship? 
7	Oh my God! This is like romantical.
7	You've come to the right place, buddy boy.
7	Can you imagine that guy?
7	Or was I the man of the future?
7	When did you know?
7	You're probably wondering why I'm here.
7	You wouldn't be offended if I call the police?
7	Why would they arrest you, Father?
7	Uh, it's an interesting case.
7	What happened to your coat?
7	What's your school counsellor wanna see me for?
7	And I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule.
7	Uh, here's, uh, here's this.
7	She's two hundred years old.
7	What a marvellous woman!
7	You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
7	Good?
7	Alexis, do you know what you're saying?
7	You're betrothed?
7	You won't believe this.
7	You want a baby-sitter?
7	You kids play baseball?
7	Well, I don't know, Captain.
7	She had long, beautiful brown hair and now she had very short, choppy red hair.
7	Senator Paine decided this with you?
7	Guess what his name is the captain?
7	Boy, is that hot!
7	We need an IV right now!
7	Are you crazy, Buljanoff?
7	What's up? What happened?
7	What are you wearing my coat for?
7	This is a better game than I thought.
7	Why'd you stop?
7	Really?
7	Well, that's not a very even trade.
7	I'm really not sure.
7	Leader, party just got bigger.
7	One man muzzling a whole state?
7	This licence has expired.
7	Calm down, chica. She only owes me  more.
7	You don't even know him!
7	You surprise me, Mr. Dawes.
7	Wow!
7	Well, if his books are any indication, he has lived quite a life.
7	We weren't thinking of going quite that far with it.
7	Whoa, look at that.
7	You walk awful fast for a little thing don't you?
7	Oh, there we go. Look at that.
7	What is it?
7	Who is he?
7	Out of the way!
7	You broke your husband out of prerelease?
7	Let's put this on your wrist. What is that? Ok, this is a digital heart monitor.
7	What do you mean, there's no more money?
7	He embezzled five million euros and Christine was going to expose him?
7	Just look at her. Look at the size of her.
7	What an extraordinary mother.
7	You go for the piano for the first month.
7	But why do you bring this up now?
7	Where are you going?
7	You got one bad seed there.
7	What are you spying on?
7	What is...
7	Adrian can really cook!
7	With her bare hands, she just chopped him down!
7	Evie, cannot be true!
7	Mikey, you're so ... weird!
7	Why would they change it now?
7	We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.
7	There she sat, gazing at me with her big eyes.
7	What's got into you?
7	What do you want the carpenter for?
7	Wow... you look great.
7	Oh, she did!
7	Don't you recognize me?
7	You sure?
7	She's flying straight to Madrid to be with her father?
7	And he wouldn't let you help him?
7	Who told you that?
7	That chorus, they work really hard.
7	But you have to make a change to your life, put in some effort.
7	Case, it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this.
7	You seem personally invested in this.
7	What the hell does this all mean?
7	What the fuck? !
7	Oh, he's the one who instigated this calamity!
7	All of them?
7	And we're trapped.
7	Holmes, you never told me you had a brother Sigerson.
7	Because of this attempted prison break, Beck would have to serve additional time.
7	Thought she wants to get an education.
7	This was the most-watched event in the history of the National Press Club.
7	What's the idea of turning her down?
7	What's with Pablo?
7	What baby?
7	I'll be damned.
7	What would a plate like this be doing in a World War II munition ship?
7	She wants to talk to me?
7	Why?
7	Back the starboard engine!
7	God!
7	Why don't you let me help you?
7	She was the one... who got you the passport to go to the Bahamas.
7	What's this Chicken Volavent?
7	How can you afford it?
7	What, just to see me?
7	Professor?
7	Not very lucky, is he?
7	You sure you want to do this?
7	Father, what's going on here?
7	Really?
7	You think you're my boss?
7	Uh-oh!
7	What's wrong?
7	Oh, my God.
7	The things that are done by love!
7	All right, for those people on the street, if there's any trouble, collapse on the house. Those inside, stay inside.
7	You don't say?
7	Was she really sick?
7	Hey, look.
7	Well, look who's here.
7	The press briefing room, Tom, really?
7	What have I done?
7	Uh, I'm late for a meeting.
7	So you don't know what happened.
7	But you seem to go to Russia rather more than you come to America.
7	What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
7	What kind of an answer is that against a $ million world gross? You don't say.
7	WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?
7	Juliette does not get on that helicopter with the Royals. Instead she goes over to Nick's house and tries to kill him?
7	Where's the bullets for this gun, man?
7	I and Monsieur Poirot we were already, and I would not believe so fast in someone I eat in him. I am not wrong, he has something in the sleeve.
7	What revenge?
7	I thought it was all over.
7	You're crazy!
7	But why do you bring this up now?
7	This girl appears from nowhere. Now she's talking to this guy. That's a little convenient, don't you think?
7	We don't know much about anything, do we?
7	Quick! Quick!
7	Hey! Want me to wrestle you up some breakfast? Uh-oh!
7	We should go.
7	You wanna infiltrate a motorcycle gang you don't know how to ride a motorcycle?
7	Well, this looks like a cool color.
7	We got 'em!
7	She's empty.
7	Unbelievable.
7	Why don't you just go?
7	You know, for an Italian kid, you ain't got a bad butt.
7	And I'm being asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to?
7	At first I was like, Why did I run away?""
7	All you have to do... is point her out and look the other way.
7	What a tool!
7	This morning this place was filled with books, wall to wall!
7	They've all left their tire tracks on the desert roads.
7	She won't answer her helm, sir.
7	And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea. Well, a couple of pounds.
7	Unbelievable.
7	You see. we're not like you think we are.
7	Nobody knows anything about what's happening here.
7	No.
7	Why isn't he at his desk?
7	What brings you back so early?
7	Yeah!
7	What did he bring his pigeons for?
7	You really like her, Carlos?
7	You're kidding me.
7	What do think I contacted you for?
7	She knew something.
7	How did you find me?
7	You didn't know he's back?
7	Sister Liz, I've got to give the girls their Religious Studies class in fifteen minutes.
7	Who are vicious killers?
7	Am I sure?
7	You suggested I needed a representative on Gavabutu.
7	And nice earrings for a streetwalker.
7	By heavens, an Englishwoman.
7	Who are you calling this late?
7	Your opinion is that this was... A staged rape?
7	She eats!
7	I demand you stop this charade! You... Demand?
7	This is too beautiful to wear.
7	What are you doing? All right, come on.
7	You're crazy.
7	Ah, you should have stuffed her in the car with the friend.
7	And I was thinking more of sushi?
7	Well, it has a firm hand, I must say it.
7	Oh, the storm's coming.
7	What's this doin' in your ear?
7	So, are you on holiday or...?
7	That's better.
7	Come on!
7	This is crazy.
7	Paul?
7	She has the name of a man.
7	But how can there be a question?
7	He's not here, darling.
7	She was wearing them tonight.
7	So there really is someone named Hsiao-tsing!
7	This is quite a setup they have here.
7	You never spoke about it.
7	But, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul.
7	No. - Really not?
7	An odd coincidence, both of you turning up here.
7	What's Zharkov doing on the plane?
7	You love him?
7	You mean to say I have this all to myself?
7	You think the soldiers are Russian?
7	Think I should go out with Paulie?
7	Red boy. You know that's a white man thing, innit?
7	That sounds worse than it was.
7	What is not going to be easy?
7	And you were right there!
7	Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!
7	Fatter? - No, Dad.
7	Lombino?
7	Oh, you must be from around here.
7	He went into Baphomet's chamber.
7	Oh, Phyllis!
7	I was kind of expecting a shit show.
7	He was here?
7	Was?
7	Now, that... that would be unexpected.
7	He'd been caught stealing rations. - I see.
7	I beg your pardon?
7	And then this morning - I lost 'em. - We lost them.
7	Why did you change words in the middle of the sentence?
7	Where is he?
7	Don't you find that restful?
7	If this is an escape route, why didn't you escape long ago?
7	You're not gonna believe this.
7	You've got a gun.
7	You're sure of that, are you?
7	Fritz, are you leaving the company or something?
7	Maybe she has a sister.
7	But I want to know why.
7	Oh, my God!
7	I see you're as adept at breaking into houses as you are into cars, Morales.
7	Hey, look at this.
7	Where is he?
7	Kirk didn't even look at me.
7	Allow me to get that bag for you.
7	Hey, hey, I'm off duty. Grand central station, please.
7	Look, money!
7	And then he says, l sure hope he was guilty." Then he laughs."
7	Why are you so good to us?
7	Oh, honey!
7	And so I clicked it and... There was the pictures of my daughter.
7	Don't touch him, he's hot!
7	Just one?
7	I killed this person for their money, right?
7	Is that why I had to come alone?
7	Your book is brilliant... but it lacks scope.
7	Do not.
7	Thank God you're all right.
7	Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before?
7	Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
7	You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
7	Someone gathered the powders to sleep to the tonic?
7	Are you joking?
7	The whole buck?
7	You done real good, son.
7	Not an idiot?
7	Back in , I thought I had it made.
7	What's Taylor got to do with this?
7	Is this the time, or I am blind?
7	Acid?
7	He's quite right. There's nothing wrong with eating dog.
7	Yeah, like what?
7	What about the horses and the cattle?
7	Why should I take the chance that I lose it?
7	I like the bubble. - Yeah?
7	A good-looking girl like you?
7	Mark: There's a big wind coming!
7	You hadn't had much contact with her, then?
7	Qualified?
7	I'd always heard how badass you Grimms were, but your mother was a complete letdown.
7	Excellent!
7	It's just me.
7	So maybe if I screw you and take you to the opera, then I can be happy. Hey!
7	All ?
7	And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
7	If you become president, would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?
7	Heavens' name!
7	Jesus, they weren't taking any chances!
7	What do you mean, they're gonna try?
7	Holy shit.
7	Giants!
7	How'd they know you were on this train?
7	Why didn't your operator look at the other indicators?
7	Why do you say that?
7	What's Taylor got to do with this?
7	I am a clown, and puzzled only by his presence in a place such as this, among such people as us.
7	His Majesty is very demanding.
7	There's Ben and Flo Healy going out to yet another birthday party with their new son!""
7	I cannot believe I am forced to defend myself once again for the actions of a criminal.
7	What are the chances of finding that?
7	Did you come over in that aeroplane that I saw flying round?
7	Exactly how inexpensive?
7	Are you trying to say something?
7	He used a grenade?
7	Oh, sir, you forgot your map. And our million dollars.
7	Don't you recognize me?
7	Ms. Winston... everybody has a secret face.
7	I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.
7	What are you doing here?
7	As far as I'm concerned, a coconut hit you on the mouth.
7	You were married.
7	Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess.
7	No. Well, I'll tell you what.
7	You're not trying to get a story?
7	Oh, this is a Kandinsky!
7	Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
7	What a welcome!
7	What's that for?
7	How can you ask me that?
7	I must have been crazy.
7	Nuclear peace for  years.
7	A vampire...
7	Kurt, he shouldn't be up here.
7	Why is she crying?
7	How did you learn to fight like that?
7	A heroic thought, Barley.
7	It is nothing like we figured out.
7	Don't you ever sleep?
7	Next thing you know, boom.
7	I wonder what he's got against the marines?
7	Junior when are you going to learn the difference between a rock and a nose?
7	You know I talk to it sometimes, and I beg it to wake me up.
7	Where's your sense of humor?
7	I knew it all along though, didn't I? What else it is new, right?
7	It is infernal!
7	How's it taste?
7	This heat is really something.
7	Maryk showed me a log he had written on Queeg's behaviour.
7	I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200,acres.
7	What the hell is this, Decker?
7	You question the judge's integrity?
7	A quarter of a million dollars?
7	Come on, man.
7	Can't I go down to San Berdoo and get it fixed?
7	Enough with the water.
7	What the hell? - To see if she was a Grimm.
7	Boy, those English sure have a lot of guts.
7	You've fallen in love with him? Did you kiss him? On the mouth?
7	I must have been crazy.
7	You're right. But it wasn't me, sir.
7	I thought you'd be happy.
7	You sure this is the right address?
7	Did you do this?
7	There ought to be some...
7	Your vendetta has dragged on long enough.
7	What happened in church?
7	What are you gonna do all by yourself?
7	Did you?
7	You've seen what?
7	I didn't know I had one.
7	Your Honor, isn't that a question for the jury?
7	But how do you know that if you weren't there?
7	Oh yeah. I had been knocked out in the pub after a shotgun to the head.
7	Suppose I could prove it to you. Suppose I asked you for your help. Would you give it to me, without telling anybody, not saying anything to anyone?
7	Those girls! Wild drivers, sports cars!
7	You're men!
7	And the kid you're taking off... you give him ,.
7	No, I don't even want to do that.
7	No. ls someone looking for me?
7	Looks like we're going that way.
7	Let me give you this watch.
7	I disagree.
7	Louis, don't you have your own secretary?
7	Look who's here.
7	Everybody's a boat freak?
7	Oh, my God.
7	Who, you mean the current acting President of the United States?
7	Ackerman? -Yeah!
7	It was just... something happened that... hasn't happened in like  years.
7	God, he is a tough old bird.
7	I know him.
7	Bethany, did you know that your dad two-steps? Really?
7	Hey, who turned out the lights?
7	He never even heard of Queeg.
7	It astonished me.
7	Harry, how did you do it?
7	Oh! Sorry. You made me jump.
7	Don't I know?
7	Nobody's going to come looking for him?
7	A rather odd reaction.
7	Not very hard, then.
7	Aren't you pleasant. - Yes, when I wanna be.
7	I don't understand what's going on today.
7	Uh... we're just gonna do nothing?
7	Hey!
7	Where are the new boys?
7	Selah.""
7	I admit nothing.
7	Double six. Ouch.
7	Hmm. - We're not underwater. Yeah.
7	I didn't jump.
7	Are you kidding me?
7	Are you abandoning the search?
7	No. This is Oscar.
7	Now, don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
7	Haven't seen you in a long time.
7	Are you upset?
7	Pa's no killer!
7	Are you hurt bad, mate?
7	Hey, if you think I look bad, you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.
7	Can't I have everything?
7	Oh, I see.
7	I work with a junkie?
7	Are you so sure that Phillip will attack?
7	Like what?
7	Oh, yes!
7	He can't be your friend.
7	It wasn't something that we could see, it wasn't in the paper.
7	Don't you think it's funny?
7	No.
7	Ooh, its breath was like a furnace!
7	Are you still mad about London?
7	Are you sure it was there?
7	That's him right there!
7	I've been doing some checking on you, Mr. Caulfield.
7	How do you live with it, Miss Bruce?
7	How come you just didn't have a baby?
7	It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible.
7	I'm not a bimbo you can tie up and do what you want with!
7	You only get one pass at it.
7	Are you kidding me?
7	I don't know, the words just slipped out.
7	Got a guest, fam!
7	He was the technology.
7	After that, things kind of went downhill.
7	My club? Really?
7	Is that what you want?
7	Are you crazy?
7	Have you forgotten it?
7	Are they all hollow shells? !
7	I didn't marry her under my real name.
7	I am innocent!
7	LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED, UNDRESS, SHOWER, BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED
7	Why wouldn't they have told me?
7	No luck?
7	Why can't they get along without us?
7	I thought you were a confirmed private.
7	Help!
7	Are you serious?
7	You have the most unusual name, too.
7	I don't want this!
7	Isn't this the same desk...?
7	Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me  more minutes.
7	You got him hooked?
7	How do they explain a man walking around with his neck broken?
7	It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody.
7	These guys don't know how to work their VCRs.
7	It's a glitch in your system.
7	Oh.
7	I can't.
7	He was here?
7	I thought you said something.
7	It was them! They sent it!
7	Ning!
7	I don't chase the nines.
7	How did you do that?
7	Mr. Dawes, do you think really that I could be a star?
7	Do not try to skip!
7	Raymond knew he was taking bribes?
7	Didn't you march today?
7	I don't know if he was a good man or if he was a bad man.
7	Don't tell me you're embarrassed?
7	It was certainly a heart attack!
7	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle, what is it?
7	Yet you turned to him for advice when you wouldn't turn to your husband.
7	Where is she?
7	Hello, sailor!
7	It works! I'm cured!
7	Am I, Max? - No.
7	Lacy, watch out!
7	Oh, my God.
7	Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian.
7	He was kidnapped. Kidnapped?
7	Do you speak english? - ( speaks spanish )
7	How could she be there if she got on that helicopter?
7	Mom. Nice to see you. -Hello.
7	I thought communications were out.
7	Did you think we don't know about your affair with a government official?
7	It's unbelievable.
7	He's a bit soft that Inspector, isn't he?
7	That's very gracious of you.
7	Doesn't it frighten you that there's a killer at large?
7	Are you really a singer?
7	Never tasted better. There's a fork on your left, Mr. Land...
7	Jesus!
7	Did I hear somebody call for their old man?
7	Did you see that?
7	Do all directors come to ask young women to sit with their producers? Um, not all.
7	It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses, the more it makes, because of the carryovers with the write-offs.
7	How did you know I was here?
7	Is this how it goes?
7	Oh, it's just surprising.
7	Mrs. Stubbs!
7	I haven't seen you around their office, though.
7	Do Russians never think about life?
7	How dare you, you... How long has she been in this condition?
7	Me not work?
7	collect the scratch! - What about him?
7	There's no way I can have this kind of exposure.
7	No, Dad, we adopted.
7	I'm shocked.
7	At this picture With your mother in bed
7	I shall not translate.
7	Maybe he'd better start carrying his own matches. Oh?
7	When do we leave?
7	I don't believe it.
7	I haven't seen you for a week.
7	My scarf. Where's my--?
7	It's a CIT?
7	I didn't recognize you standing up.
7	I said, Are you fucking crazy?""
7	Miss Wynn is going with you?
7	When does he ever hear me swear?
7	Do not do this to me, Yanis.
7	No, I don't guess it is.
7	Look, a fist!
7	Oh, my God. It's the devil.
7	Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh. -Dress it. Quickly.
7	I think that I'm pretty enough, but I would not want to be that kind of star.
7	I discovered that actually Rommel was not in Africa... when the storm of battle broke.
7	lt was Brennan. - How do you- l tailed him.
7	Look!
7	All that money, Baron?
7	I can't get it out of my head that Junior was responsible for the camping thing.
7	You're the busiest woman I ever saw.
7	What about him?
7	It took me a week to find this crap.
7	Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
7	Look at all that underwear.
7	Hey, you know there was a guy in the game that accused me of juicing the deck?
7	It hurts!
7	I just got wised up to something funny the last few days.
7	Now, that's original.
7	That meteor is either very light, which is unheard of, or it's hollow.
7	I can't go through it... You hear me?
7	Ninotchka, when we first went to my apartment... did I have the slightest idea that you were connected with this deal?
7	Aren't you going with Broderick?
7	Where the fuck is he? Arnie!
7	I never thought of that, sir.
7	I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.
7	You mean, people can hear me now?
7	I mean, jeez...
7	Here are the keys!
7	I don't know.
7	Oh, my gosh, you must be Darlene!
7	Didn't they ask you about this?
7	There's more bad?
7	Hawkins, what's your status? -Hawkins, talk to me!
7	Are you?
7	Hey, is that Paul?
7	Don't you understand?
7	Are you quite certain this place was full of people only a few minutes ago?
7	Something very unusual has happened.
7	Hey dad!
7	It's back!
7	No!
7	My uncle is dead, I swear.
7	Like your shoes, it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did.
7	I made a special effort to not look like a nurse.
7	Doesn't a doctor have to do that?
7	He can't do it in the club so he makes me call Tony outside, and he jams him.
7	Someone we know?
7	Not bad for an old-timer, huh? I'll say.
7	Just what is this relationship between you and our friend?
7	Joséphine?
7	Majesty I can present ... my young daughter, the new Countess of Verua?
7	Nearly creamed us both.
7	I've been looking everywhere for you.
7	Do I look like a baroness?
7	Hey!
7	Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
7	Is she the one in the painting?
7	Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
7	He didn't say anything about a dam.
7	But if you're in love with him, why are you skipping out?
7	I'm sorry, I'm conducting an examination.
7	But there is a great deal of evidence that they are concerned with our hostility.
7	Ah, was from there.
7	What do you need money for?
7	Is it real? Is it real pig?
7	I'm getting adopted.
7	Holy Jeremiah Johnson.
7	I'd have to lead them through.
7	What are you doing here?
7	Not until you've finished.
7	They don't know he's here, do they?
7	How could he say a thing like that?
7	I don't know these sailboats.
7	Those girls! Wild drivers, sports cars!
7	Do you really think they can do anything?
7	I didn't think you'd shoot.
7	Would they mock him?
7	Holy mackerel.
7	What does my height have to do with anything?
7	He's right there!
7	Did you think I was a lady?
7	They notified me.
7	Why the sudden change of heart?
7	Cops!
7	I thought you weren't a romantic.
7	Are you kidding me?
7	I was lucky I come across her last.
7	It's a miracle they lasted as long as they did.
7	You had me worried there for a moment.
7	Clearly, you're not like everyone else.
7	Now that you mention it...
7	Isabel, you look very lovely tonight.
7	I'm dreaming!
7	I know, Bob, but...
7	But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on.
7	I didn't even recognize her.
7	Jeanne!
7	Jesus... - Christ on a crutch.
7	An engineer?
7	If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to Copenhagen...
7	Ladies, I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros.
7	Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed?
7	How do you know all that?
7	Does it mean you want me to go there?
7	How could you let her do a thing like this? What?
7	I just happen to be taking the same train.
7	Mommy! Mom!
7	I thought he didn't drink.
7	Isn't that a dog up there?
7	He's alive!
7	Don't give us hunches.
7	I knew there'd be a catch to this.
7	What happened to him?
7	Jesus!
7	You gotta settle down or you're gonna wake him up.
7	Oh, thank you.
7	I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200,acres.
7	He went 'bang'!
7	How did you know my name?
7	Is this our new car?
7	I thought I gave you plenty of time to...
7	Anyone'd think you didn't want to get better.
7	Why did you take him then with me?
7	Daddy?
7	I can't do any more after that.
7	How did eggs get into the conversation?
7	Ah, Muldoon, you're a charmer.
7	You could love me?
7	Mike, are you OK?
7	But it did leave them to be BFFs.
7	No, for Philip and Elizabeth.
7	Six months ago, who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas together?
7	Opening night never starts on time.
7	My goodness, you have such an attractive little garden here.
7	Tri Face!
7	Daddy. You want to name her daddy?
7	A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac... and an uncle!
7	Look what just came in.
7	Alex, you remind me of someone I used to know.
7	And I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away.
7	When have you had a date?
7	Why is it that you know so much about them?
7	Do I actually see this?
7	Holy shit!
7	I don't believe it.
7	Now neither one of you are making sense.
7	I didn't say you could move.
7	No! You know what you're full of, Seth Dove? Sin!
7	It's an investment?
7	She can verify that!
7	Excuse me?
7	How big is this thing?
7	The Lady herself Inglethorp!
7	He got what he wanted.
7	I can't believe that.
7	Remember, when you invited me?
7	Noise, what's that noise?
7	When did you discover that?
7	No.
7	What'll take to get you to realise I'm givin' you a chance to pull yourselves together?
7	When I came back from the war, I had a son.
7	Why are you doing this to yourself?
7	Oh!
7	You're the guy!
7	What is that, a threat?
7	Is he always like that?
7	She is a real lady.
7	Hey, Angelface.
7	My God!
7	I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral, sir.
7	Now isn't that jolly?
7	Your finger got bited from your mouth with your teeth? Uh-huh.
7	No!
7	Usually, this woman is gentle as a dove.
7	Feeling better, I see.
7	The chauffeur? The stable boy?
7	Christ, she's got tits the size of cucumbers.
7	Father!
7	What a strange-looking dogl
7	What do you mean, call?
7	Take all the time in the world, Barley.
7	Now, they were mostly destroyed, but I was able to recover data from one of them.
7	He'd been innocent!
7	I can be president of the United States!
7	Oh, my God!
7	Carlos really digs you.
7	I'm impressed. Go ahead, detective sergeant.
7	What a levitation move! Jesus said unto him...
7	Uh, off message throughout.
7	You mean in the morning?
7	That only took two seconds.
7	We, uh, have several people in mind.
7	I see. So what do we do now?
7	All of a sudden, there's a lot of noise.
7	What kind of car?
7	But how can there be a question?
7	knots through the harbour?
7	You were incredible today.
7	Well, you said the name of the boat on television. I knew it was Bob's.
7	There! I got it.
7	How did you manage to get so friendly with Frank King?
7	But do you truly believe that by deliberate present-day action we can neutralize that possibility and alter the future?
7	Then he was relieved unjustly?
7	Heavens' name!
7	I thought you'd gone.
7	What is wrong with you? Come on!
7	I've never been invisible before.
7	You thought I was in this for the money, Tommy?
7	Case, it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this.
7	It's a one-way street!
7	Am I interrupting something?
7	You really are afraid of this place.
7	How did that happen?
7	What happened to him?
7	Why did you do it, Andy?
7	They gotta be out of their minds!
7	When I came here, I thought this was gonna be a 30-day stretch, maybe 60.
7	The stewardess is flying the plane?
7	Ain't that the girl Whitey Carter went lookin' for?
7	And everybody say hello to kit-Kat!
7	Cool, thank you.
7	Except you honked the fucking horn.
7	Hi! - Hi! - What the fuck are you doing here?
7	Thank God.
7	You are going to get us all killed If you keep on antagonizing him.
7	A performance that exceeded the most optimistic predictions.
7	I can't believe it!
7	So you really think they're keeping the missiles on a ship?
7	Is there no justice in the world?
7	What's that got to do with a train?
7	What should I be afraid?
7	I like him so much.
7	Well, I know a few of the guys.
7	As far as discretion goes, what were you and Evelyn doing, comparing notes?
7	So, I cannot imagine, my dear Elizabeth, why you should wish to involve yourself.
7	He's mad. It was an accident.
7	Wait, and you never went to the cops after all these years.
7	Look who's here.
7	Oh my God! You guys are all a bunch of freaks.
7	I can't believe it was you on the phone.
7	Ornery as a mule, just like Owen. -l heard that!
7	Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
7	Is that chilli?
7	Am I good with that statement? I marked it up.
7	I didn't know you played a saxophone.
7	And I was thinking 'Why haven't they arrested us?'"
7	Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
7	I don't know. I don't know.
7	What a place to be stuck.
7	So now they're best friends?
7	You're Bing Chow? !
7	What, do you think I consider it recreation?
7	You knew that too?
7	Boy, you amaze me.
7	We all thought you were dead.
7	You count good, but where's the change?
7	This doesn't make sense.
7	How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
7	Go! Out of here!
7	Marie-Hélène, how do you do?
7	Did you see the Giants?
7	How'd you boys know where to find me?
7	What are you doing here?
7	You hiding him, boy?
7	You have absolutely no reason to be afraid of the King.
7	Ah! - You should listen to your brother.
7	Really?
7	I concluded that this was not an objective study.
7	I can not believe it.
7	What the hell is going on out there, George?
7	What do you mean?
7	There's a shitload of that.
7	I'm impressed.
7	What has happened to your friends, Father?
7	She's pregnant?
7	Those men hadn't even thought of that.
7	Oh, that's what you're working on?
7	Hold it!
7	Seems like it takes a crisis to bring us together lately.
7	He gave me some work to do and he left.
7	Really. - Am I no longer allowed to give gifts?
7	Why would a rival biker gang crash a bar full of Vagos?
7	There she was, the world's number one symbol of desirability, on display all over the world's number one showroom, with the world's number one customers wanting to buy, and nobody wrapped her up and took her home.
7	Who's probably taking the day off again?
7	It's a miracle.
7	Did I hear something about jewels?
7	Cam?
7	You did or did not get those records? - I did not.
7	Now what makes you think I hate her?
7	I wasn't looking where I was going.
7	You were right.
7	Trubel killed Juliette?
7	Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news.
7	How did you get here?
7	That's Tommy's, he values that. He won it! Good!
7	But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
7	I've never seen such activity.
7	Damn Charley, this is your last wish?
7	Who is this woman?
7	That's confusing the issue.
7	No, not, Hastings.
7	They wouldn't let you take your dog?
7	Nurse!
7	A Webley automatic...
7	You love your brother?
7	I can't believe it.
7	And he who spies and flies away lives to spy another day.
7	Chappie, you said that if Brennan came up dirty, you won't take him in.
7	Ain't she seen a man before?
7	She wears the pants alright, but somehow she always strips her gears.
7	You gotta be joking. - I neverjoke about money.
7	What's your hurry, honey? He's not gonna run away!
7	I saw it, but I didn't believe it.
7	Hey, she loves those flabellina oculina!
7	So they took your offer as an insult.
7	What's that got to do with it?
7	But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
7	Script girl.
7	I thought it was all over.
7	What happened to you?
7	Judges need to be educated, the public needs to be educated, the Department of Justice needs to be educated on exactly what's going on here.
7	How come you bought one?
7	Alexis, do you know what you're saying?
7	Oh, that's funny.
7	Alec, you got here fast.
7	And you're it.
7	What the hell?
7	Quickly!
7	Holy shit.
7	It is to you and you that my name means nothing.
7	There he comes!
7	Why isn't he traveling with you?
7	Yeah?
7	About what happened. When?
7	How did you find that out?
7	I saw the same book in her room.
7	Smuggle their manuscripts out to the West?
7	Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market... and found you'd made your bed, sir.
7	My life is a surprise.
7	How are you, George? -Fine. This is a surprise.
7	Did you ever wanna sleep with a man?
7	That's the first encouraging thing you've said.
7	Daddy, you found Suzy!
7	A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac... and an uncle!
7	I did a catalogue with his names and residences.
7	This is very big, you talk only to me.
7	Look what's in the street.
7	So you're behind all this.
7	And I got so drunk I puked spaghetti everywhere.
7	I sent you all those letters.
7	It means I got my own lead. I saw a guy in the bar a couple of hours ago.
7	Holy shit!
7	Promise me that you are not a spy, and then I will make you a promise in return.
7	Come to think of it, everyone did look kind of undressed.
7	Who? - I don't know.
7	Blair's tapes encrypted, bounced by satellite to London, then decrypted - all in minutes.
7	Thank you for asking.
7	How about-- this cereal is really good.
7	They look like giants.
7	Can't you tell me what's happened?
7	She kissed you?
7	Really?
7	Look out below!
7	I see that it's funny.
7	It is too expensive to maintain, Leslie!
7	It's hard to believe about Henry Tunstall.
7	He didn't say anything about a dam.
7	Because I do not like you, Mom.
7	When did this relationship take place between Raymond and Carolyn?
7	When I gave these files to her, they were in nice order.
7	Don't you know it's bad to light forest fires?
7	Did you hear that, honey?
7	What're you still doing here?
7	Man, he is a lot bigger.
7	No! Are you crazy?
7	Oh, my God.
7	Let's not get carried away here.
7	You still workin' on that deal?
7	What were you seeing him about?
7	Barney! Barney, what a day.
7	That is some horse.
7	Your brother taught you to kiss?
7	I don't trust him.
7	What are you doing?
7	I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you.
7	That's wonderful!
7	What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?
7	Won't admit that it exists.
7	Get rid of your gum.
7	Her father murdered her mother.
7	Uncle Bob?
7	I declare, Billy, sometimes I think you got psychic powers.
7	What's an angel?
7	You never told me your father was...
7	They took the one with the collar?
7	$, for a taxi!
7	Styles Court is even glorious!
7	How'd you get in there?
7	If you didn't try new things, there'd be no progress.
8	He's nervous, you know?
8	A whole new life with a family that values what you are.
8	I'm going to be out here if you need me.
8	I'm gonna enjoy this.
8	Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.
8	One of my favorite spots.
8	We all have that fear.
8	But I owe Jeff something.
8	Want a drink?
8	When you can see into this crystal, then you will be ready.
8	It won't take that long.
8	I came home because I didn't want to worry you.
8	Actually, I kissed you because I couldn't control myself
8	Yeah, she's a nice girl, Melba.
8	Elder, what should we do now?
8	He certainly can.
8	Honey, why don't you go out to the kitchen and bring us some of those... fancy little hors d'oeuvres.
8	Remote and useful.
8	I'm with Rosalee. You're on speaker.
8	You're my wife and I love you... even if we don't get the baby.
8	Well, my mother was a music teacher and married my father, whose family was extremely wealthy.
8	I wish you Godspeed.
8	A sense of humor.
8	I'll take care of everything.
8	I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help.
8	But in time Tommy Gunn may be able to fill his shoes.
8	Nice meeting you. -Very nice meeting you. See you.
8	Okay. All right, look, everything's fine.
8	Well, that was a mistake. I can vouch for her.
8	Yes.
8	And we know how to do that, don't we boy?
8	Thank you for asking.
8	He is not only older and wiser but his present trouble has taught him precaution.
8	But you wouldn't know anything about that.
8	She was so kind of offering hospitality to seven of my compatriots, refugees of our birth-place.
8	Maybe this war is necessary.
8	The usual, sir?
8	I'll give it back to you in the morning.
8	If you take a swim, I'd have to take a swim.
8	I've known those kids since they were in preschool.
8	These are the ministers and advisers where you can trust.
8	How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
8	I think Tom does make sense.
8	You'll go together and keep working as a team.
8	You can do it.
8	I know our men.
8	I'm supposed to have some interesting dreams.
8	Here there's a roof over your head Might as well stay here
8	All I'm askin' for is a chance.
8	That's right, boy.
8	He'd trade his soul to the devil in return for that one moment of real happiness.
8	Even with her being as broken as she is, she shares so much love.
8	You may be right.
8	I'll go to her next Quick, give me your hand
8	The X-rays will be along shortly.
8	Good stuff, was it? - The best.
8	The cockroaches here are of the best quality
8	Thank you, baby.
8	Well, then, I'd say the reason that you broke up is important.
8	Faxx knows what she's doing.
8	Do you want a beer or something?
8	Your mother was my dearest friend.
8	Father, is it all over?
8	If he said they're here, they'll be here.
8	He's told you all he knows.
8	Second floor secure. -Right.
8	Now you're talking sense.
8	Young lady, would you pull down your dress? Sure.
8	Dick, thanks ever so much.
8	You've made me a very happy old man.
8	Here's what you're going to do. You're going to go back to New York.
8	I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril.
8	Everybody just loves Junior.
8	Jack, since you're not going on the cruise, I could use you at the store on Monday.
8	Since you're their representatives, I can tell you that I'm prepared, right now, to give you a James Madison.
8	But I believe what the prosecutor said.
8	You're so expert on things.
8	He does do right well for himself.
8	Everything's going to be alright, son.
8	We haven't left each other's side for the last two weeks.
8	Doctor, you're with me.
8	If he speaks on your behalf justice will triumph
8	Will you lend me a bullet?
8	The sea shall have you back.
8	Well, here's to, uh... community property.
8	The figures I have just quoted indicate an efficiently run organization.
8	I'm gonna see you do the right thing.
8	She's exhausted, but she's okay.
8	I have known what it is like to be in love, to be married in a church to a man that I love,
8	Will you arrange a conference for us?
8	Everything's gonna be okay.
8	Yes, of course.
8	He remembers everything.
8	Today, the captain ordered a general drill for the safety of the crew.
8	You can be proud.
8	To serve your country.
8	Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought.
8	You must tell me a few of them.
8	Excuse me. I know this is bad timing.
8	He knows no more than Chappie.
8	Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
8	He's honest.
8	He was the technology.
8	Well, she helped me.
8	I appreciate that, Agent Beeman.
8	Very loyal.
8	Since I'm a one-man show around here, I think I'll forgive myself this one time...
8	And I know how hard you been working to build somethin' for yourself and Marcy.
8	Guess my old man's not such a bad guy after all.
8	She helped the Royals take her. We're going to need you on this.
8	Come on, come on, don't drop it...
8	Look at you, baby girl! Hey, you ready to blow this joint or what?
8	I see that it's funny.
8	She is my best friend.
8	He isn't half the father you were.
8	Could you show me where they are?
8	Do as he says, everyone.
8	I tell you, our side will always win.
8	And when the shooting starts... she'll be there to look after the girls.
8	Hold on, I can handle this.
8	Agreed.
8	Just throw our hats in the air.
8	But he's got a good practice.
8	Follow me.
8	I will satisfy you.
8	They sure have all the right equipment.
8	Very well. I'll introduce them to you.
8	Just hold it steady until I tell you.
8	A safety-first Clyde.
8	Hey, captain, could we get a ride with you?
8	Here, the kind of respects.
8	We do our best.
8	Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime.
8	He takes good care of that.
8	You sound like a rug salesman.
8	You're going to do all right without me.
8	It's out! -Are you all right?
8	Yeah.
8	That's how I feel about it.
8	That man really does his job.
8	Hanford has extensive outdoor experience.
8	The guilt and just feeling ashamed of yourself, I've struggled a lot with that.
8	Do you know something else, my friend?
8	♪ I swear by my tattoo ♪
8	I still need it when I'm afraid, like a baby who needs a light on in the dark.
8	Don't worry.
8	And we take care of our own here.
8	David, you can have the Giants tickets.
8	And a very powerful one.
8	I'll talk to him.
8	Hang tight. Hang tight.
8	Oh, sure. They have a terrific dental plan. But that wasn't why.
8	Hank, she's dead.
8	Harley, you and Lee give me a hand with this door.
8	Good British plugs.
8	He doesn't want any trouble with anyone.
8	Oh, my goodness!
8	The front controls seem to be all right.
8	Hey, Flo. Come here.
8	Not unless you're crazy, baby, and crazy you are not.
8	Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?
8	That's why you and Mickey were special.
8	Did you ask God to be with you and keep you strong?
8	And may the best man win.
8	Seeing you, Luis.
8	Gentlemen, the philosophy is pure Zen and the method is pure science.
8	But hell, what a cop.
8	Even if you get past me, there are  cops waiting outside.
8	Listen, if things don't work out, you can get in touch with me in Minneapolis.
8	It is you whom I love, much more than this.
8	And if you were my friend, you'd do the same thing.
8	Captain, there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under.
8	Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try.
8	Now, it will go under in  to  hours.
8	But he's the best cameraman I know.
8	Shake on it, bruv.
8	Carol, I want you to transcribe these notes for my report.
8	These are good workers.
8	Good old honest Shooter.
8	You're out!
8	I'm telling you. I want to be there when Francis Underwood says to me that there will be an increase in Medicare.
8	The best!
8	Everything will be all right.
8	Ramos, give me a hand.
8	Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore.
8	How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
8	Hey, I bet you'd look good in one too.
8	If it's OK with you, I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand.
8	They'll do everything that can be done.
8	He was very understanding.
8	All right. Welcome aboard.
8	Anything you need, I'll call administration and have them authorize the tickets.
8	Because you were right about Magnus.
8	It's in a car outside.
8	They're them, I'm still me.
8	Hephaestus will do what he can.
8	You're too smart for this.
8	Hold this for me, will you, pal?
8	Come in and I'll get you a nice, cold glass of water.
8	Not to my way of thinking, no.
8	You're stronger than you think.
8	There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.
8	I'll see you tomorrow.
8	She's quite right. I'll look after them for you.
8	Judge, you said we would be entitled to some leeway...
8	I asked you to come here today to discuss the sale of your formula.
8	Well, it's our way of trying to understand.
8	It's gonna be very dangerous.
8	I can't beat three sevens.
8	I'm impressed. Go ahead, detective sergeant.
8	Take me with you!
8	Considering the candidates who answer to the high qualifications of senators, one name shone out like a beacon.
8	You are in charge.
8	That brought it down.
8	And you are definitely not insane.
8	Besides, she's new.
8	We're partnering on a project.
8	And then I'm gonna get this right back.
8	They tell me you're quite a stud player, young man.
8	Did you follow through of what we discussed?
8	Thank you for letting me trespass.
8	I respect your new life.
8	Besides, whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom.
8	These bills are put together by legal minds after long study.
8	Engineered like no other car.
8	In case you need a quick getaway? I know how you feel.
8	He wants to give you all his support.
8	Boone, I'm not gonna leave you!
8	The spirit world, man.
8	Thank you, Pulovski. Thank you very much, man.
8	You look like an honest man.
8	If you'd like to come with me. Yes.
8	If you got a plan, Jack, you better be letting me in on it.
8	It was my scarf.
8	Gentlemen, there's a God in heaven.
8	I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
8	For the safety of the ship I obeyed Mr Maryk's order. -
8	And when that bill passed, I was so proud.
8	But I shouldn't have left like that. I'm sorry.
8	Okay.
8	He's so brave.
8	In , I formed the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence, to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations.
8	She's a friend.
8	He's lying.
8	The judges that are making these decisions are gonna be read about in history.
8	Can't you find me a key?
8	( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind?
8	Thank you!
8	Help yourself.
8	I'll show you how to make up your eyes and your lips.
8	You know, I'm thinking of training you for cashier. Really?
8	Just relax for a minute and then tell me all about it.
8	Graham? I forgive you for failing.
8	Shooter knows what he's doing.
8	Sir!
8	It's as corrupt as America, but... there's less bullshit.
8	Maybe you'll find the explanation for his disappearance inside.
8	Yeah, how you doin'?
8	My very best friends.
8	Yes.
8	Pricks, one and all.
8	She knows, wanted, of certainty that this cushion is wet.
8	The Navy has three psychiatrists who will testify that Queeg is sane.
8	Big house, three cars, beautiful wife.
8	The sword was her husband's.
8	These little rascals make life worth living.
8	Sure, Tommy.
8	You know what I'm talking about and so does everybody on this set.
8	Good old honest Shooter.
8	This technology would liberate Earth from fossil fuels, environmental devastation, and poverty in a single generation.
8	You know, he's... he's been so kind to me.
8	But with you, kid...
8	I'm obliged for your hospitality.
8	That's a relief.
8	Let's do it.
8	Yankee Bravo. Nightingale . We have reached Kuwaiti Star's position.
8	Does that make you more comfortable? - Man:
8	You're in no particular danger, I think.
8	Now put the wings on it.
8	It'll be history.
8	Certainly you would give any information you had on a case... To your investigating staff? Certainly.
8	I've been trained for it.
8	A battleship might be more comforting.
8	I need something something that can fly and that can scare the pants off anything living in that castle.
8	Elder, you can save us
8	I must admit, you put some very convincing arguments on this table.
8	I love you.
8	Let's be honest.
8	I'm going to answer whatever questions the inspector wishes to ask me.
8	I told the police what I saw.
8	We're onto something.
8	We're doing the right thing, Cathy.
8	Let me show you to your new house.
8	I told her you didn't fuck around.
8	Yes.
8	I love you now.
8	I knew that if anyone could help me, you could.
8	I was hoping you'd be an example for him.
8	Surely I can give him a word of advice.
8	Shall I see you to your cabin?
8	I'll protect you.
8	You can make it, old girl!
8	There's this sudden thrill, like... while the person you love is inhabiting the same world as you.
8	Please forgive me, Phyllis.
8	You were right.
8	The key is, he's an animal.
8	I'll give you their home numbers.
8	I hear you, Ned.
8	So, I'm here.
8	I hope that you will uphold justice
8	You're a genius, old boy!
8	I am satisfied by you, Hastings.
8	Look you're better here coping than in a clinic giving up. You're gonna be out here eventually coping anyway.
8	Well, thank you for your help.
8	You'll have your own room with all the conveniences.
8	Seek out and engage the enemy."
8	My offer is a very fair one, and doesn't even take advantage of your situation.
8	Well, there's no mistaking this German beer.
8	We live in a wonderful life.
8	Sweetheart, look what just came in the mail for you.
8	I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail.
8	Oh, great, Hal.
8	I'm giving you the chance.
8	Yes.
8	Yes, Elder
8	You've always been the stronger character.
8	Get down there, son!
8	don't let it get you down.
8	Thanks.
8	That is true.
8	We have to save each other, because all victims are equal.
8	Good.
8	It should be fun doing some detective work.
8	Pecmans? Buttissimo? Ah, the old abba dabbas
8	Sure. I'll be right down.
8	I want you to get some sleep tonight.
8	Take a deep breath, relax, move on.
8	Thanks.
8	I'm glad she's on my side.
8	Listen, maybe you and I could get together sometime after Edward leaves.
8	McLeod's depending on you, Scorpio.
8	You're the guy!
8	He'll show you when it's finished.
8	We can attend to your needs.
8	I'll figure it out.
8	Wow.
8	Don't worry about the others, they're just senators.
8	Lombino is king.
8	You're welcome.
8	I solved your case, that's all.
8	Tom Dickson is a friend of mine.
8	Love you.
8	I thought it my duty to warn you.
8	Marie said she couldn't go out tonight, so I said she could use the parlour.
8	See you later, darling.
8	You've exceeded everyone's expectations, the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...
8	Well, we'll figure something out.
8	You knew nothing about DeVriess and you know even less about Queeg.
8	It almost feels like you're one of us now.
8	Fear not.
8	Is the water boiling? Yes
8	You and that winning personality of yours.
8	I think it's brilliant.
8	Thank you.
8	I wanna marry you.
8	Will you hold this a minute, please?
8	We need good cops, and they say you're good at what you do.
8	Cheers, man.
8	He's the only senator to have.
8	I don't think he killed Mildred Atkinson.
8	I know you're all right... and a good woman at heart, even though you might have took a wrong turn in life.
8	If I was you, I would go home and talk to your family people.
8	CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact.
8	If we act together, we will survive together.
8	Your Majesty.
8	With your help.
8	You're right. I don't have to come, but I wanna tell you something.
8	This can be established.
8	They never have and they never will.
8	Which we tried to deliver here. This is not evidence.
8	Am I good with that statement? I marked it up.
8	Yeah. You should stay, Isabelle.
8	Promise me?
8	That's a good idea.
8	Good work, Carol.
8	Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
8	Here, at least, I'm a little star.
8	Great day for it. You look glorious.
8	I'm in.
8	You need a somebody.
8	Are you feeling well, Anatoly?
8	Go steal one someplace for yourself.
8	Mr. Marshall, there's a message from Mr. Jones.
8	This is yours, sir.
8	We need the Sheriff.
8	I hit him. He went down.
8	I'm a fighter.
8	Doc, can I go with you to the AA meeting?
8	Make it up to you.
8	And as long as you've got this wedding ring on, you've got me.
8	Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.
8	Come on! Try it out.
8	By the time they're done shitting' their pants, I'm long gone, right?
8	Aye, sir.
8	We'll share it.
8	Your orders.
8	You let me down, Mike.
8	And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's -story gift to the Motor City.
8	I could take care of you, Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.
8	The committee wishes to emphasise that there is no evidence of any wider conspiracy.
8	Alice Lee, honey, would you like to freshen up Mr. William's drink a little bit?
8	I promise.
8	Your officers will work beside you.
8	Where are you going, man? - I was gonna sit-- I'm gonna sit down.
8	You really could be a nun! Thanks.
8	Our own Mayor Kuzak.
8	You, too.
8	That I will faithfully execute...
8	You worked with Alvarez, Lopez and them guys.
8	I think it'll support us.
8	Yeah, she's a nice girl, Melba.
8	In this world full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust.
8	I know.
8	Tommy, these trunks is very special to me, you know?
8	My little Marco.
8	He's a perfect little gentleman.
8	Just let me take her back with me.
8	Remember to chew them well, okay?
8	I just...
8	Some gang!
8	I wanna say I appreciate what Capt. Tanner's done on my behalf.
8	How kind.
8	I was proud of the State of Washington.
8	I went through all his papers very carefully.
8	Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
8	Whatever you need, it's yours.
8	How about it, kid?
8	Young man, you have a good heart
8	Would you repeat it in court?
8	You're perfectly right.
8	Gerald Ford's son used to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof, play Led Zeppelin to his friends.
8	It's about time they brought them from the force into here, right?
8	I don't want her hurt at all.
8	These guys sure aren't the DEA, but it's still Keyes's party.
8	Are you in here? Yes!
8	Deeply grateful.
8	Thank you very much for your attention and your interest
8	Give me all the covering fire you can spare.
8	We'll take care of him, sir.
8	As an ensign in the United States Navy. - - You go down to the sea to fight in the toughest conflict of all time.
8	Relax, Happy.
8	What do you do with yourself in Lisbon, Barley?
8	Yes, ma'am?
8	And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
8	You don't have to worry.
8	Loomis, could we have two seconds alone?
8	I report it. I'm a journalist. -You're involved.
8	You're gonna be out for as long as it takes--  weeks,  weeks, however long.
8	It's a better world, we're all bound for.
8	I'll do what I can, Mammy.
8	He is the owner of Texas.
8	That's normal. That's what she should be doing.
8	You guys don't hear nothing, cos if you did we wouldn't be sitting here.
8	They do not want to separate of you.
8	You worked for it. It's yours.
8	And you must be Mr Barley.
8	I got nothin' to lose.
8	Robbers, plural?
8	I can't say it on the phone, but I need you to help me.
8	I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.
8	That's all that matters.
8	You were terribly in love with her.
8	You done real good, son.
8	I'll get some help!
8	You're invaluable, Richard.
8	I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this.
8	I want to talk to you tonight.
8	I understand... The prosecutors have suspicions.
8	I'm gonna go get the kids.
8	This is a great exercise for the inner thigh. When I count to ,
8	I promise.
8	Yeah, we're working on it.
8	Maybe we better get inside, OK?
8	I love you!
8	Fucking asshole. I love you.
8	A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder.
8	I'm not kiddin' around.
8	I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.
8	They value their writers.
8	Thank you.
8	I must be honest with you.
8	I'd really like your help.
8	You've done a helluva job with the man.
8	All right, then.
8	Remember, Daddy loves you.
8	I told you I didn't do anything illegal and I didn't.
8	Please, Lieutenant.
8	I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help.
8	Why don't you just start talking and let's see how it goes?
8	Will you think about it? - Yes.
8	You help me and I'll make you rich.
8	Come on, stranger, hop in.
8	You'd still be my Carla.
8	I know.
8	No, honey the drink's on me.
8	Well, the least we can do for Nick is find out what we can about Chavez.
8	Need a little help.
8	I love you!
8	I assume you can prove that if necessary.
8	As soon as we get near those cattle pens take Alice and drive her out of town as fast as you can.
8	I'm sorry. Do you mind getting the door, please?
8	It's been... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work.
8	I knew there was a story in that guy.
8	Surveillance is my specialty.
8	Sammy, are you sure about that?
8	Wanna make me proud, kid?
8	My wife went to a lot of trouble.
8	These bills are put together by legal minds after long study.
8	Shall we bid our guests farewell?
8	I'll put money in his bank anytime.
8	I'm gonna do it again.
8	You may call me Captain Nemo.
8	Please. -Could you get Suzanne a Coke, please? -Sure.
8	You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
8	Anyone can make a mistake.
8	There must be a reason.
8	I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but I want you to tell me the truth.
8	Even though we were close, even though you betrayed me, and I trusted you, I would never harm you.
8	You needn't worry.
8	I want to do everything I can to make your job easier.
8	I know you want to get out of here, and so do I. We're going to do it.
8	I got it from the best authority.
8	You'll have a chance to judge for yourself.
8	Therefore, I'll always get laid more than you, which is fundamentally unjust, am I right?
8	You are everything I would want as my wife.
8	Please love and care for this orphan child.
8	When you get on the roof, lie flat!
8	These people want to disappear more than you do. They won't bother us.
8	It's a nice sentimental gesture, CinCPac sending your old cruiser.
8	You were right.
8	Pleased to meet you.
8	Maybe you're right.
8	The King accepts our proposal with great enthusiasm.
8	I'll go a distance with you to point the way.
8	Use your influence, Louise.
8	Every citizen will have a living unit, safe, secure, and clean.
8	If your men are as cocksure as you are, they might get through.
8	You want me to hang on to our cash.
8	I'm glad you told me about this.
8	Slip the jab, Tommy!
8	I married Tibey because I was in love with him.
8	That was very considerate of him.
8	It was a good idea.
8	I heard you're having some trouble finding help.
8	My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
8	Six days of this and I'll make you a hero.
8	I think it's about time we go out there, don't you?
8	Sure, Georgie, yeah.
8	So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure?
8	I hope you don't mind my asking, and, believe me, I'm thrilled that you did, but why did you accept a blind date?
8	I'm gonna name her mommy.
8	She stood for justice.
8	They spent their own dough to get here, and they came here to see us.
8	Listen, don't forget my door is always open to artistic people.
8	I'll be yours if you don't kick in with that $10.
8	The margin for error is narrow here.
8	Well, thanks for the flowers and everything.
8	Father Logan is an old friend.
8	You'll learn quick enough.
8	Let them look.
8	Take a couple, sir.
8	Good old Swayback.
8	I just want it in a flaky pastry.
8	Yes, I do.
8	You have nothing to fear.
8	If I need you later on, will you come over?
8	I'll break it to her gently.
8	He's quite right. There's nothing wrong with eating dog.
8	I'm telling you, it's gonna be all right.
8	Oh, he's only kidding.
8	I'll take care of you.
8	Yes.
8	Yes, Father, I'll tell him when he comes back.
8	Yeah, well, he's busy, you know. I didn't want to make waves.
8	It's for you.
8	Get in here, come on.
8	Thanks.
8	But until then, Mr Boot, you'll get yourself the best newspaperman you ever had.
8	I don't have any secrets.
8	Come in out of the rain.
8	That is undoubtedly true.
8	He's trying to help.
8	Because we belong together.
8	Good. Yeah.
8	Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
8	Now, are you in for $,?
8	Don't have bad dreams.
8	Listen, I've got something for you.
8	So I'm just asking you... to be with me.
8	Your boat, my boat.
8	People sense these things.
8	Did the kids get to eat all right?
8	I'm still wearing a bow tie so I can look just like you.
8	Sure. Use my box. I'm asking you to watch it with us.
8	Please, I beg you.
8	Are you all right?
8	Hold my hand, please?
8	that we were never to be apart again.
8	You can still climb in that kiddie car and take a hike... unless you can fight better than you can drive!
8	If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.
8	You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.
8	I want you to handle this case personally.
8	Don't worry, last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open.
8	Take a vacation, let things cool off.
8	That's a good thing to know, Frank.
8	You write the long word on top of the page, and under it, you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one.
8	It's all taken care of, Papa.
8	You're perfect.
8	And you're amazing and this would be amazing.
8	You want to know something interesting?
8	Me and you are alive.
8	The only two sober people there.
8	I'll pay both of you.
8	Even so, mon ami.
8	Anything that benefits the state is mighty important to me.
8	Try it yourself if you don't believe me.
8	Find and fulfill your destiny.
8	I'll be proud of you no matter how you do.
8	He'll talk to you.
8	Well, I can have a word with you.
8	With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do.
8	Such an honour that you rode my horse!
8	I wouldn't trust you with gold. That's why this is only worth a penny.
8	I might be able to accommodate you.
8	London control said you can continue on with your mission.
8	Good luck, Barley.
8	He hunts in the morning, he comes back in the afternoon.
8	Here. Relax, fella.
8	Well, you're so good at fixing things maybe you'll fix me a light.
8	He runs the best parish in the archdiocese, and he's a good man.
8	Do not try to skip!
8	Tom Dickson is a friend of mine.
8	Lovely lads and so natural.
8	I thought of you.
8	Mark: Once upon a time, there was a little boy named isaac
8	You and me, we do business.
8	See you tomorrow.
8	We never miss.
8	You've got a customer.
8	Well, will you talk to him about it, sometime?
8	I need you to help me.
8	Want to take a look?
8	Is there something I can do for you, ma'am?
8	I think it's safe.
8	Good luck, Harding.
8	As always in my life, everything begins with my family.
8	I wanna thank you for what you're doin' for my son, Tyrone.
8	The hero of 50,000,boys and 100,000,parents.
8	I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch.
8	You need not be afraid.
8	So, what do you want to study?
8	That'd be great. Thank you.
8	We need protection.
8	What's wrong?
8	Your mom's not a giver-upper.
8	The Caine's a floating mistake.
8	Man, you beat the best.
8	I'll see if I can get through.
8	But our kid will have a loving mother and father, and all the advantages that I can give him.
8	I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent.
8	I know bad that this mission cause you grief, lady. Is of great importance for our country.
8	And I do have a plan.
8	Thank you for keeping us alive.
8	Big-hearted guy.
8	I'll be there.
8	I'll take you to him.
8	There. Have no fear, my son.
8	That's my girl.
8	It's all right.
8	It's okay.
8	Who taught you? No one taught her.
8	I'll not say another word until I do.
8	Good morning, Mr. President.
8	I don't care, it's not mine.
8	This is an honorable proposal of marriage... made at what I consider a most opportune moment.
8	And we learned a lot from you.
8	Gotta have good nerves, though.
8	That's the way this business is run.
8	I may smack you around every once in a while, but I'm still your brother.
8	Why don't you sit down and have something to eat?
8	I promised.
8	Yes, but if we can't, we lose Rhode Island.
8	I mean, you said it yourself, Loomis. He's born for this.
8	Petrov.
8	Yeah.
8	Here, in the house of God.
8	That means she can probably handle the kidnappers on her end.
8	Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me?
8	Grimm needs a little reassuring.
8	For instance,  million pesos is not what it used to be.
8	Can I ask you something?
8	Are you hurt bad, mate?
8	He must have a plan.
8	Good luck.
8	I invited you.
8	Mr. Steele, could I keep the book till you come out?
8	If you wouldn't mind giving me a lift.
8	Okay sweetie.
8	This is most evil of all.
8	Right there... in those big blue eyes.
8	No, sir.
8	If any of you have the time or interest, I would welcome your help.
8	We understand each other all the way.
8	We need you to know what work we'll give you.
8	Help me with these eggs, will you? -Sure.
8	We all have ideas of right and wrong. - - But we have to pitch in for the good of the family.
8	Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
8	I hope everything's going well with your marching.
8	And he fought for them for the only reason any man ever fights for them.
8	It means I got my own lead. I saw a guy in the bar a couple of hours ago.
8	And in that, you will be essential, mon ami.
8	You taught me everything.
8	Really, it is so good to see you.
8	Are you willing to fight, men?
8	I admire this gentleman.
8	You're gonna be fine.
8	That's what friends are for.
8	And dead ahead, is home sweet home.
8	It's just fear and priggishness to believe in limits.
8	I had trouble like that when I was in school.
8	Yes, Commissioner.
8	Why, Matt, what are you talking about?
8	Thank you.
8	Look, is there someplace that we could go and talk?
8	Whenever you want to visit their plants, they are open to you.
8	I will protect you.
8	I also love the King.
8	Good boy, good boy.
8	So you fell in love with him.
8	These are my friends.
8	I just took care of him.
8	But I love you. I want you, Isabelle.
8	My dear, I've never denied you anything that was in my power to give.
8	What bothers you?
8	Well, I'd appreciate it.
8	She's got "champion" written all over her.
8	You can do it!
8	And life begins again.
8	I'm gonna do it alone!
8	It's for you, the famous Ringo.
8	So, congratulations, Admiral Torrey.
8	I'm sorry.
8	And that she's really worried about you.
8	She's not a spy.
8	This is for life.
8	You are doing very well.
8	Paulie, are you OK?
8	Your ship's been in lots of battles.
8	You know, compadre?
8	You will not bleed.
8	You look beautiful.
8	I promise.
8	Your opinion might be valuable.
8	Where does it go from there? What do you say?
8	You remember this guy.
8	Part of the family now.
8	You. I trust you, Chappie.
8	Please, relax.
8	That's my old man, Kid.
8	Yeah, that's it. That's it. I love you, Ri-Ri!
8	And I trust you.
8	I know how much that hurts.
8	I'll take care of you.
8	You know what we're fighting out there, and they know it!
8	In this world full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust.
8	I never heard anything more true.
8	Am I late? - No, no, not at all.
8	I love it when he does that.
8	Sit down there.
8	I know, but we have so much love to give.
8	Got it?
8	And it's the truth, of course.
8	We can protect you. If you stay here, they're gonna find you.
8	Just like I belong as a priest. And your mother and your husband too.
8	I'm doing everything in my power not to fire you.
8	I just... I like him.
8	It changes your whole perspective.
8	I'm a friend of the family.
8	Want me to pick out one for you, Dutch?
8	I got it, but I don't know.
8	I need you so much.
8	We will go as fast as you.
8	I want hugs. - Morning hugs.
8	But after all, you're the logical man from the West for the national ticket.
8	I will complete the task. Out.
8	That's right. It must be.
8	Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
8	That's what I do.
8	How about the three of you shaking hands?
8	I'm going to stay with you.
8	That dumb old college would be lucky to have you teaching there. You tell her, kid.
8	He's gonna let one of us go.
8	I promise you that.
8	I'd like to see an Underwood administration.
8	You found courage.
8	That little gal means more to me than the whole wide world, Shooter.
8	Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
8	This is maybe the most important case that we handle in our legal career.
8	And do remember me kindly to your charming wife.
8	He should be part of our celebration.
8	You earned a piece of it.
8	Good.
8	We're perfectly in sync, Claire.
8	You're right, Michael.
8	You're our best shot.
8	After  months of combat, it takes  hours a day to keep her together.
8	Well, I was wondering if you could hold something for me.
8	They tell me you're quite a stud player, young man.
8	I roll with him all the time, and he rolled with us on that move.
8	I like.
8	These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain.
8	That's why I had to find you to tell you.
8	Enjoy it.
8	It's all right, Colonel McNally, they're friends.
8	Thank you.
8	In fact I should.
8	You made a mistake, that's all.
8	If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
8	It went 'pop.' Exploded.
8	Thank you very much.
8	( babbling ) - it will be fun have one of these in your house.
8	Gentlemen... if there are no objections, I'm the dealer.
8	I thank you all for your continued service.
8	I'd like you to meet somebody.
8	We'll try to be fair.
8	As for the rest of what I have to say, you will find it neatly typed at some length, on this piece of paper.
8	Make it a single, Phil.
8	You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
8	What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight.
8	There. There.
8	And I might add that he has some rather strong ideas On the subject of sea monsters.
8	You and I are such similar creatures.
8	Oh, I'm sure it was just a nightmare.
8	And for Broderick.
8	I will watch over you.
8	Cameron's been used to the pretty islands.
8	Thank you, Miss Haynes.
8	We have to go back to London, so we're going to stop off and see you on the way.
8	That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
8	You'll report to SIOC with Jane every morning to continue your mandatory sessions with me.
8	Without the ring, there will be no sacrifice, without the sacrifice, no congregation.
8	We will now take an oath
8	Gentlemen, gentlemen. You don't understand.
8	It's to show I love you.
8	Lord Fu is not a traitor
8	I represent the belief of far more people.
8	That's a fair question, Schultz.
8	Sal, I gotta go see my son, if it's all right with you.
8	What if I just lean back like this? Would you rescue me if I fell?
8	Today, the captain ordered a general drill for the safety of the crew.
8	It's a deal.
8	We got to find Atreyu.
8	She rescues him right back.
8	Wilbur, don't worry. We'll come back the moment we find the boy.
8	I'll do what I can, Mammy.
8	Plain and simple.
8	I loved our life together, the school, subway walking you home, the two weeks we took in St. Thomas.
8	And given your background, I'm sure you can figure it out.

8	I do. I like her a lot.
8	I gotta hand it to you, you'd make a great con man.
8	You had me worried there for a moment.
8	They asked me to give it to you.

8	It's big enough for two.
8	It's okay. It's mine.
8	Keep in touch.
8	Then you ought to understand why I can't.
8	You got the proof.
8	I understand.
8	Because there are many Generals and Admirals and very good officers I had met with who have enormous responsibility that everyone if you pulled a thousand people on the street,
8	We've always embraced the very things for which others have burned you at the stake.
8	You know, Esmeralda, you're the only one on this barge That understands me.
8	I thought, l'm in love."
8	Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
8	Please. Understand I was taken by surprise.
8	Here, we'll take care of this.
8	There she is, my other monster.
8	We'll all squeeze in.
8	l should think you would.
8	Extra-terrestrial bodies, yes.
8	No sweat.

8	Yes, I confess.
8	That's nice. Thank you.
8	Graham. We missed you, buddy.
8	Thank you, ma'am.
8	And listen, I want to thank you so much for helping us with this.
8	In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships.
8	It's okay.
8	Oh, don't worry about it, Captain.
8	Thanks.
8	I got faith in you.
8	He says he doesn't want presents, but you know him.
8	And we've got her.
8	Promise?
8	You've been greatest friend to me.
8	I've been doing just that for years, until Sergei walked into my shop last week.
8	I think you can.
8	There's a time for everything.
8	Honey, if you change your mind, just let me know.
8	Don't worry, Mama, we'll find them.
8	It's me and you.
8	Then you take care of her.
8	I need a lift home.
8	You should not be afraid to touch me.
8	Piedmontese navy will be very important in your life.
8	Honey, it's nice to have somebody take care of you.
8	It's home....
8	They're meeting my first demand.
8	I'll do that.
8	I think I might love you, too.
8	Don't you worry about Jake. He can handle himself.
8	We're not one-issue voters.
8	And you're remembered not for the winning, but because you never lost.
8	My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
8	Don't worry if you hear firing.
8	Look after my things.
8	Just take a breath.
8	I'll be assisting you through the entire process.
8	I brought my man Charlie here to see how you big boys work.
8	Make sure she gets to that church this evening.
8	And Shooter, Lady Fingers and me just carried them right here.
8	Yes, of course.
8	I've had enough, thanks.
8	Well... it ain't French, but...
8	Promise me.
8	Do not worry, he does not know anything.
8	Then it's all settled.
8	Matt, you trust me, don't you?
8	I've got a job to do, but I'm not hard to get along with.
8	I've known Zharkov for almost 30,years.
8	Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in, has contacts in several universities.
8	Good luck, Mom.
8	And the island is surrounded by warships.
8	As am I. The black community deserves so much better than Frank Underwood's failed policies.
8	You got it? - Yeah, I think so.
8	Will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said?
8	You know what I'm talking about.
8	I appreciate this damn thing more and more every day.
8	Take care of her, Sallie.
8	Go get them, kid.
8	He knew my father very well.
8	You sure come to the right place here.

8	That I cannot do.
8	Specialist to the nursery.
8	I appreciate what you're doing, Armando.
8	I'll be right outside. Good.
8	No unpleasantness, I hope.
8	I reckon I'll see you later, ma'am.
8	OK, but it's the last time I set foot in this house.
8	You go out, call him up, tell him to surround this place with police.
8	I'm in control.
8	You can count on that.
8	With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do.
8	Don't let it beat you.
8	I'm sure you did, I'm sure, corporal.
8	And one step further from prison.
8	Blair's tapes encrypted, bounced by satellite to London, then decrypted - all in minutes.
8	You come with us, and you got a chance.
8	That's the way to do it.
8	No need to worry, son.
8	My God, he's done a wonderful job.
8	And with your help...
8	Madrid was easier!
8	We're not gonna hurt you.
8	He's led us on many a cattle drive.
8	I'm proud of you!
8	I'm the one who can-
8	Sure, go ahead.
8	Atreyu, get real!
8	Take my word for it, and don't try it.
8	She's an angel.
8	He was a London bus driver, and when I was a boy, he used to take me over the river to Mayfair, where the rich people lived.
8	Then talk to me. Tell me what happened.
8	I don't deny that you might have a case.
8	Of course, we're cooperating fully, Al.
8	And they should, you know... American people can handle the truth.
8	Bob, Bob man.
8	I think he'd be very gentle.
8	I'll look after the horses.
8	You see yourself doing right, and you do right.
8	She wore a ribbon, and always had white dresses.
8	And it's like she wants to be my mentor, which is exactly what I needed.
8	Alright son, start passing' that chicken 'fore it loses its juice!
8	Take this, you'll feel better.
8	These men are loyal and devoted.
8	Thank you kindly, Melba.
8	Take our offer.
8	Just promise him.
8	You must teach me.
8	Got it.
8	100% truthful, Ace? - Yeah.
8	Yeah, we know the place.
8	I love it.
8	It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us.
8	Do we look like people that are capable of committing a crime?
8	We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.
8	And I want you.
8	My grandfather gave this to me just before he died.
8	Ah, yes! 'I had a migraine, your Majesty.
8	I'd never leave you, Daddy.
8	Just kind of go like this all the way around.
8	I'll make you a deal.
8	I'm sure Tibey would want you to stay.
8	Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.
8	How can we ever repay you?
8	Pat, I never did thank you for hauling me out of that river.
8	You'd best come home with me.
8	So that I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in an honest way.
8	Why did you turn away from me?
8	I'm your brother John.
8	I'll take you home.
8	I'll take good care of it.

8	Don't worry, he'll be along.
8	Don't worry about it.
8	Assure Senor Mendez that he'll be in our prayers.
8	Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
8	Did you oblige him?
8	I want Mommy!
8	I think you know everybody here.
8	I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
8	And you have my coat ready for me when I'm ready to leave!
8	You should rest.
8	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Father?
8	Honey, you comin' to bed?
8	You're a handsome and powerful man.
8	On the day he presented it, I congratulated him.
8	Okay, I'm with you.
8	I said I was sorry. That's the end of it.
8	I liked him, but not a lot.
8	Bless you. Father, how can I possibly thank you?
8	Get a message off to Pearl.
8	I'll cover you.
8	Could I talk to you just for a second? Sure.
8	That's why I love them.

8	You're in charge, sir.
8	Professor, I-I'd like to speak to you.
8	We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments.
8	We have an idea that might help.
8	I mean, I realize you don't have to answer me, but don't forget I helped you into this world, okay?
8	Consequently, you've been selected to hold the key position in the coming' festivities.
8	You'll see that I get away all right, see that I get to a doc?
8	Johnny knows what the men want.
8	And loyal to you, ma'am.
8	Kirk, my dear fellow, I know just exactly what you have in mind, and I couldn't agree with you more.
8	You tell him I've got Boone under control.
8	Let's forget it.
8	Don't be afraid.

8	It'll make you feel better.
8	Well, I'd appreciate it.
8	It's only temporary, you know?

8	Can I have your gun, please?
8	Hold on, gentlemen, please try to understand my position.

8	Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.
8	I'm sure you want to be getting home.
8	I want to tell you something.
8	Right with you, Shooter.
8	I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.
8	He's less a gigolo than anyone in our immediate company.
8	I'm ready to testify. He'll go to jail.
8	I'm thinking, I did it.
8	I'm an honest businessman, a good husband and a father.
8	He never make a fool of myself, ever.
8	I don't expect nothing. I'm nonchalant.
8	And this evidence is clear... And uncontested.
8	Take care of her, Mr. Hastings.
8	If central government should ever fail, power can be transferred instead to a system of local officials dispersed across the country.
8	You have talent, I made the best use of it.
8	She'd come back, soaked to the skin, but always with the same excuse:
8	Also, I'm in love. I... I'd like to get married.
8	I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
8	I'm obliged to you for getting me out of the fix I was in.
8	I love my brother.
8	By the way, Mr Kovak, I'd like to praise you for bringing this to my attention.
8	Hector Eubanks was the fireball of our little cocoon.

8	That is true.
8	We're old friends.
8	I promise.
8	Come right in.
8	Am I wrong, Lady?
8	Sit down, be comfortable.

8	And Italy is a very moral country.
8	He's a real pro.
8	I'll fix you something to eat and call Hank and tell him we're not coming.

8	Let me explain something to you.
8	Died thinking it might be over between us.
8	I want the men to be happy.

8	I promise.
8	She ain't gonna talk, man.
8	Come on in.
8	I'm gonna cut you a little slack.
8	Well, all I can say at this time, that the most important thing is unity... and the public's faith in the institution of democracy.
8	Leave it to me. I'll tell you.
8	You committed the perfect crime.
8	I can tell the occupation of a man by looking at him.
8	Don't you worry about it.
8	Get in the truck, kiddo.
8	Maybe God is telling us something.
8	Lord, camphor is the only known cure.
8	Be that as it may, it is a loan.
8	It's as true now as it was then.
8	Absolutely.
8	Eat all of your stew, children.
8	Good boy.
8	I'm really gonna enjoy this. - Give it a rest, will you?
8	That would be nice.
8	All I can do is put you in tactical command of the operation.
8	You know who that was, Kid?
8	We'll never be parted again
8	Make yourself comfortable.
8	I care for you very much, Inglés.

8	How far back do you and he go?
8	I'm with you.
8	You're not afraid, huh?
8	Well, no, but it's got potential.
8	I won't ever do it again, I promise.

8	Uh... anything for you, you sweet little muffin.
8	Help me!
8	He's complete now.

8	Don't you stay up too late, OK?
8	Let me know if you see anything, huh?
8	You want you and Tommy to be tight.

8	I don't care what it is, as long as it floats.
8	Gotta duck down lower. Go under the wind, go under it!
8	Both of you give him a hand.
8	I think you've solved the problem.
8	We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last  years, more than  planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support
8	See they're sweet, daddy?
8	Don't bother explaining
8	If we're good nuns, God will see us through.
8	Do you want me to come with you?
8	Just give me the stamp. I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your name is.
8	We've known him since we were kids.
8	Hey, it's all right, baby.
8	He ought to be president.
8	There must be a reason for this.
8	It took some guts.
8	Here, let me help you.
8	I was as close to him as I am to you.
8	There'll be someone, don't worry.
8	If you ever want anything, anything at all, just ask for Brian.

8	Don't worry, he's harmless.
8	Don't worry about it.
8	Mr. Chisum, if I can do anything for you...
8	She's a wonderful girl.
8	He's got all those.
8	They're right.
8	I'm with you.
8	There was no more innocence anywhere.
8	Thank you for your kindness.
8	Go ahead, you can be frank.
8	Thank you for making me a Human Being.
8	You just give us the word.
8	I'll make amends.
8	Everything's gonna be okay.
8	I know old Pete.
8	Don't you think she's paid her dues?
8	Thank you, Randy.
8	Howard, how are you?
8	Shooter knows what he's doing.
8	Boone is with Baphomet.
8	Dear, it's no good feeling sorry for yourself.
8	Check every floor.
8	You have your orders. Aye, sir.
8	I'll sit by your side until you're ready.
8	You know, just have more fun with it, that's all.
8	Have you got anybody with you?
8	I'll help you.
8	He'll know how to handle things.
8	I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
8	I know that you are tough.
8	She's good at her job.
8	We'll always be here with you, ma'am.
8	We've gotta treat this guy like royalty.
8	Don't you worry about it.
8	Now I want you to tell me something.
8	You tell him to take care of you.
8	Get up, you son of a bitch, cos Mickey loves ya.
8	Yo, remember where you are, my friend, before you start acting like a fool.
8	But Lawrence never speaks with me, it will be possible to avoid it.
8	It's... Not that big a deal.
8	In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is no risk.
8	We've got you, clear.
8	Your wine, your Majesty.
8	Man, I always thought it was the mezcal talking, but after seeing this, I think he was right.
8	He's terrific. He's on it.
8	He's the best man in the world.
8	Or some professional individual saying,
8	It's all right.
8	I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
8	Clearly, you're not like everyone else.
8	Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that.
8	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers, so it's hurting.
8	I should say not.
8	They will not fail.
8	I know that old man.
8	You are my only hope.
8	Good luck to you.
8	Of course you're going in.
8	You're not dumb.
8	But I want to be with you.
8	Well, now I want to be loved.
8	You have to focus on the road.
8	A true Commander-in-Chief.
8	Tom, give us a bit of help.
8	Nice work, Isabelle.
8	Have you ordered yet?
8	Very well, sir.
8	You'll be called vice president, but you will be, de facto, something more.
8	He ain't such a bad horse.
8	We've simply got to convince you that you're going to serve the right cause.
8	Don't worry about it.
8	Go get my children and you bring them back.
8	We thought you might like to look through his papers.
8	Your Highness slept well?
8	The way I thought it might be.
8	Then, when you've recovered your strength, we'll discuss the plan.
8	You got yourself a job.
8	I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent.
8	I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing.
8	Help me.
8	It is not educated. Then it repents.
8	He owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City... which lets us alone.
8	He asked her to marry him after the war.
8	Let me say the password.
8	You watch me.
8	I called you as soon as I heard.
8	In two years time, he's gonna make a run for it.
8	I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.
8	I'm making a hundred K a month cooking and dealing crystal meth.
8	I don't know, but now that we're aware of it, we can try to track it back, hopefully back to Shepherd.
8	You are correct.
8	I guess you're right again.
8	You get a bonus and a raise.
8	He did something wonderful.
8	You needn't worry.
8	Boy, did we have a great camping trip!
8	Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight. The weather's clear to San Francisco.
8	Good boy.
8	She said she would.
8	Hey.
8	Hey. I love you.
8	I'll do whatever I can. Here...
8	Help us.
8	It's going to be all right, okay?
8	Oh, God bless you.
8	I don't have to get any place but out. Share a cab?
8	We know that there is nothing wrong with you medically.
8	Don't forget me, Bastian.
8	If you are really brave and lucky, I can make you very, very rich.
8	Do your best to keep him there until our men come along.
8	Help yourself.
8	They won't hurt you.
8	Just hear me out on this, OK? I've known you a long time.
8	How can I help you?
8	Hi, fellas.
8	But you could help us in a rather special sense.
8	Honey, babe.
8	Today you are full-fledged ensigns.
8	Well, might as well make myself useful.
8	I want you to make a little phone call for me.
8	You must have some idea where he was going.
8	He can help us.
8	What must have been painful and difficult questions for you... Considering your relationship to the defendant.
8	Hi, honey.
8	You can take my word for it.
8	Your brother's a master at it.
8	The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care.
8	We can say fate brought us together.
8	We thought you'd be safer on the ground.
8	You're right.
8	Everything's gonna be all right.
8	He's quite harmless.
8	I have no patience for any more shit.
8	Everything's OK.
8	Yes, sir.
8	I'll take care of him.
8	I know. I don't want to say. I know how upset you'll be. I know how upset I was.
8	Promise me.
8	He saved my neck.
8	I won't leave you.
8	Max, I'm going to let you in on something.
8	This is great. Thank you. - Cheers.
8	You gotta settle down or you're gonna wake him up.
8	Then take my advice.
8	You named it.
8	Oh, Rusty!
8	Excuse us for interrupting. We're from the Rescue Aid Society.
8	I'm not a complete stranger. More like a relative one. Like family.
8	Don't you think he's got a point?
8	Bad guys are long gone.
8	Well, she wanted me to tell you that she's... she's all right.
8	I'm not as dumb as you think I am.
8	He can use one of my horses!
8	Hi, Pa.
8	Therefore, we do here and now band ourselves... into a brotherhood of buccaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas.
8	I'm not going to make fun of you.
8	He's the best man in the world.
8	I'm just following orders But don't worry
8	Hi, sister. - How are you, my child?
8	She is a real lady.
8	Come on, lighten up.
8	You'd better take this extra $.
8	I see you're as adept at breaking into houses as you are into cars, Morales.
8	I expect you to take care of them.
8	Don't be nervous.
8	The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way and my way.
8	That's-that's very kind of you. I hope that you and your wife were-were not uncomfortable.
8	Do me a favor will ya, thank your mother for me?
8	You promoted me.
8	It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
8	Don't worry.
8	Welcome home!
8	Oh, yeah.
8	Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.
8	I want you to take care of someone for me.
8	Come on! -Rexer!
8	Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy.
8	Thank God you're here.
8	He is responsible.
8	From my heart, I thank you.
8	To be agreed upon price.
8	I'll do one for you. How about that?
8	Don't worry, kid!
8	I'm trusting you to be discreet.
8	I'll let you know when I get it straightened out.
8	He was generous.
8	Good night, Essy.
8	It's OK, I was thinking the same thing.
8	Coates, Murphy, take the first sentry duty.
8	I didn't call because I thought you might be asleep.
8	It's safe, trust me.
8	I think a McCaskill would be good enough.
8	You can't quit now.
8	I promise you.
8	He'll know what to do.
8	Just put me in your pocket and take me with you.
8	For the first time, when we looked at each other in the gypsy camp, and again at the window at the casino, and again just now, when I held out my hand to you,
8	We've got the perfect weapon, right over our heads.
8	She's very attractive, I know.
8	It's... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements.
8	Thank you for my victories and for my defeats.
8	She can verify that!
8	Yes, the King.
8	Listen! There's some chicks here that need help.
8	Which we don't care about losing, by the way.
8	Then you can handle it all.
8	I'm here to help you.
8	Thank you for protection.
8	If I can do anything for you, let me know.
8	Let me tell you what I said when she was born.
8	Come on.
8	He doesn't have your heart.
8	But at least try my way first.
8	There must be a reason for this.
8	Would you like me to go with you?
8	You've come to the right place, buddy boy.
8	You could be so much more.
8	I'm fucking great.
8	This is where the fun starts.
8	You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order.
8	I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
8	He won't be bribed or threatened.
8	Let the boy come in, Griffin.
8	I bet that was fun.
8	There and then before the gods, you made a pact only death could break.
8	Help me...
8	I know that your life is here.
8	I'll look after him.
8	Kuwaiti Star, we're moving into position to lower a diver onto your deck.
8	We're going to fix that.
8	We should all visit with our significant others for a few minutes.
8	You sure can make with the words.
8	He's an asshole, but you'll get used to him after a while.
8	He's a friend of mine.
8	Everything'll be all right.
8	Friends, Fred tartastein, The president of this network,
8	Raymond presses hard on every case, Nico.
8	Yeah, I got you.
8	Hi, sweetheart.
8	She ain't got nothing on us.
8	Good.
8	We care about you.
8	If she was young and beautiful, I forgive you.
8	I don't know. We just... became friends. And then it became more than that.
8	I know you are.
8	I know him. She knows him.
8	I do.
8	I'm your pal.
8	He's such a sweet thing.
8	Nice doing business with you.
8	He will help us. I'm sure that still loves you.
8	You're the hero of the hour.
8	All the best people stay here.
8	Three, for luck.
8	He'll never give up.
8	There's nothing more wonderful than children playing, hearing them laughing.
8	They're waiting for you.
8	Knows him real well.
8	Tell me the truth.
8	You're very wise.
8	Holy smoke.
8	They'll learn quickly.
8	She's the one.
8	Just be yourself and you'll be fine. It sounds trite, but it's true.
8	You know how it is.
8	Want to be a hero, yeah?
8	Let me get you a transfer, sir.
8	Somebody ought to stay with Ma and Pa.
8	Nimbly!
8	Looks like you just got your wings.
8	Take this and start a new life for yourself. Somewhere off this bus, okay?
8	Consuella is right.
8	You gave me some very valuable information.
8	This boy's honest, not stupid.
8	There are people eager to work with you.
8	I look forward to it, sir.
8	You just go.
8	My thanks to you.
8	That's good.
8	He was my first lover.
8	I'll make sure your journey is safe
8	You have absolutely no reason to be afraid of the King.
8	He can't win in the House.
8	If you like being a senator, you can come back to the Senate and stay there as long as you want to.
8	Boone, listen to him.
8	You know why I didn't hire you back then?
8	Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
8	We speak now tonight... And these things are never spoken of again.
8	However, I'm counting on you to respond appropriately.
8	...And I don't think we need to discuss the Trinity any more.
8	Oh, no, don't worry about me.
8	Show him who's boss!
8	There were others. Most of them are still with me.
8	You haven't got a little nip of something, have you?
8	Calm down!
8	He's so cute.
8	Simply gorgeous.
8	That's okay.
8	His uncle helped to design the original lunar module that put the first men on the moon.
8	I'll stay with you, Dix.
8	Just relax.
8	They're both Viennese, both good men.
8	It's as true now as it was then.
8	You can't.
8	Promise me one thing.
8	It's a deal.
8	It's Phil. I wanted to let you know - Morse is set for tonight.
8	Vice President of the local Vagos.
8	Let's stop wasting time.
8	That's better, Johnny. I missed you.
8	Decker won't tell anyone.
8	He goes to the fucking hospital, right?
8	Now take these light bulbs out back and don't break 'em.
8	It'll be there.
8	Fingers crossed, Jack.
8	I want to talk to you.
8	I've examined him several times and... I think he's begun to trust me.
8	Come give your grandfather a hug.
8	Adrian, if you weren't with me, I never woulda done as good.
8	A great dandy, but very clever.
8	I appreciate your patience.
8	Let's be honest.
8	I wanted good things for you.
8	But if I don't hear from you in a week, me and Roger are going to disappear.
8	Nick wouldn't just make that up, and he certainly wouldn't call and tell us that if it's not true.
8	Okay. All right!
8	It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one.
8	Well, this may not be the best time to bring it up, but a  call just came in.
8	I'll follow you.
8	Gentlemen, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
8	I know a good thing when I see it.
8	You want my honest evaluation of this team?
8	Here. . euros.
8	I'm sure you'll agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
8	I will pray for you.
8	Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need.
8	It is spoken on all channels.
8	I got it from the best authority.
8	Lieutenant, what exactly happened here?
8	God sees everything.
8	I have not!
8	What you have to ask is whether you will be able to resist him.
8	For pocket money he helps some of the older residents with their groceries.
8	Listen, I got a favour to ask ya.
8	I think you're right.
8	Jesus. Yes, this is me.
8	Thanks for the warning.
8	Well, rest assured, you're not alone.
8	I want you to stay on the civil case.
8	Everybody relax.
8	Don't worry, we won't take the brief, but an old friend needs help.
8	How are you? - I'm OK.
8	We can still make it.
8	Little Man was very brave.
8	Boss, you think of everything.
8	My success depends on her.
8	I brought you something to drink.
8	Yes, that's very creative, Junior.
8	I sponsored him in the Senate.
8	Well, I suppose I should thank you.
8	Tom knew his way around the old neighbourhoods.
8	Lucy's turning six this week but I don't think we'll have a clown this year.
8	Don't worry. I'll handle it.
8	See, you may have differences with me...
8	Well, you fixed everything!
8	Yes, I do.
8	And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together.
8	I am. I love you so much.
8	See. after our parents died. we were left to fend for ourselves.
8	What's wrong?
8	Come on, up and over!
8	You really are afraid of this place.
8	Don't worry.
8	He heard a fragment of her conversation with the mother-in-law, when it demanded what it links was it showing any thing?
8	You got a weird family.
8	Help! Help!
8	I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates.
8	Let me take your coat.
8	We've been through a lot together, and I don't want to see you do something, you know, without me if you really need me.
8	Save us digging new ones.
8	Don't worry.
8	Major Huglin will arrange for whatever facilities you may require.
8	Can you keep a secret, hmm?
8	Good night, Vinnie.
8	Can do, sir.
8	What were you doing there?
8	I promise you.
8	Very good horse.
8	You could tell it was for real, because they never even gave out interviews about getting married.
8	He'd like me and take me with him.
8	There is a pilot on the radio telling her what to do, telling her exactly how to do it.
8	Everything'll be all right.
8	and very loyal to Francis.
8	We solve every murder in less than two hours.
8	Of course, not with me.
8	Me three.
8	Don't panic.
8	You go home. I'll handle the captain.
8	Yes.
8	And now if... When we get a cab we can complete the plan and live out our lives with a modicum of dignity.
8	You're doing pretty well.
8	I'm a safety girl.
8	I'll see you tonight.
8	Don't worry.
8	Tuthill, sir, Operations.
8	Well, you're quite welcome, son.
8	Can I just have a second before we start?
8	Dig that hat, daddy-o.
8	She's all right.
8	We're realists, knowing that we're on the outside looking in. - We calmly accept our uncertain position. - Yeah.
8	I say this as a friend.
8	I'm not scared really.
8	Hit him, Dad.
8	You have been my friend and patron.
8	Hello, darling!
8	Rely on me, Papa.
8	You're one of the greatest stud players I've seen.
8	You want to work for somebody else? - No.
8	Women say,  lt's not the fact that you left. lt's the way you did it.""
8	Sister, ten mile' refers to Ten Mile Pavilion"
8	What are you spying on?
8	You know the routine.
8	I gotta stay with her.
8	Yes. Take care now.
8	Promise me you'll be careful.
8	That's good. He's bringing his grandson. He's grooming him to take over.
8	I promise I'll take care of the Grimm.
8	If you gentlemen want anything, just ring.
8	I wanted to congratulate you.
8	Let me tell you something about my life.
8	What intelligent devils!
8	We'll make an honest buck together.
8	Yeah, it probably is too.
8	You had plain, decent, everyday common rightness.
8	They got you off the hook for a while.
8	You worked hard.
8	And you're a steady hand, which, again, the country needs.
8	I got something for you now.
8	Roman...
8	I can't tell you about it.
8	I'm sorry.
8	That's bold.
8	You will advise Brennan of his rights and get a statement from him.
8	You drink to relax.
8	I'll get you another one. Catch it.
8	There's better things waiting for you when you get out.
8	You know what to do.
8	It's no bluff.
8	This is the right path for you.
8	And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
8	Because I want to.
8	I haven't heard the sound of home in a while.
8	Well, anyways, onward and upward.
8	No matter what's happened, this child is going to need you.
8	You were right.
8	Now it's yours.
8	I hate to ask you this after you've been so helpful but could you do something for me tonight?
8	This is where you'll be living.
8	I love you.
8	We have so much.
8	I think my cook has managed guess what I like.
8	We believe what the gods did when they made a man crazy was... make him fall in love.
8	You might be able to find something out there alone.
8	I am so sorry. Hi, buddy!
8	They cannot be here, so we ask you to consider them in your decision.
8	Well, I'd say the New York money will probably lay about... oh, - on Lancey.
8	We are witnessing the making of a legend, George, the kind of thing that front covers are made of.
8	Natural to get cold feet.
8	Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.
8	I never heard anything more true.
8	I've got something to tell you.
8	I love you.
8	If I give you a raft of it now over the phone, can you print it up and spread a billion copies of it?
8	But I don't think you have to worry about this one.
8	He's not without experience, you know.
8	Absolutely.
8	I'm going to need you to put your hands up.
8	I'm gonna give you something to remember me by.
8	Beautiful.
8	One of the best.
8	We are moving, babe.
8	I taught him.
8	You understand what that would mean.
8	Och, you don't want to let them worry you.
8	The thing is safe.
8	But don't let them take the boots.
8	He's in on it, sir.
8	UFOs are as real as the planes flying over your head.
8	I resolve you... Absolve you!
8	But, she can be very generous sometimes.
8	Aye, aye, sir.
8	Rely on me, Papa.
8	It's taken care of.
8	I love Erik Bauer.
8	He knows you can do it, so do I.
8	I'm prepared to make a donation to the people of this town.
8	Yeah, he's right, we got to keep moving, Nick.
8	That was really the heart of my sincere interest.
8	You are in love with her.
8	Perhaps you could enlighten the jury as to what else the government's giving you in exchange for this testimony.
8	Now, if you will just give me the name and the address of the person.
8	Thanks, baby.
8	I don't want to see anyone or smell anyone but you.
8	Thank you for the privilege, sir.
8	No complaints, you're reliable-
8	Nobody's going to get hurt here.
8	Continue, Mademoiselle.
8	We are not so vulnerable.
8	You hit the books tonight and I'll listen to you tomorrow.
8	Would you both like to come?
8	Thank you.
8	Yes, I have.
8	Of course you're not crazy.
8	And how do you know that?
8	I will get Fornell out of the way.
8	I would put money on us.
8	I would do anything for the woman that I love.
8	We.
8	Yeah. -That's right.
8	Came out and took off. I stayed with him.
8	Smile.
8	Let's straighten up and fly right.
8	You take care of these people.
8	I'd like you to have this.
8	He wants it all hush-hush.
8	( giggles ) oh, you don't.
8	Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
8	I'll take care of him.
8	We'll make it if we're careful.
8	You want me to check that oil?
8	You want a job?
8	I'm working on a plan to get your case reviewed.
8	Oh, okay.
8	Get me some water.
8	Maybe I can help you to get out of it.
8	Love thy neighbour.
8	Beautiful. - Uh-huh. Yeah.
8	It's bad.
8	Absolutely. Please, go and see them.
8	Eigerman! - He was right about the motel.
8	Good boy. Very good boy.
8	I'm sitting on something. I've got to say it to your face, Counselor.
8	We're in this thing together.
8	I'd appreciate your advice before we leave.
8	Well, I guess that's the good news.
8	We're counting on you.
8	You belong with me.
8	You don't gotta love it, you just gotta do it.
8	Dad, did you know your bones grow three times as fast at night?
8	My idea is that the government lends us the money and then the boys pay it back by sending pennies and nickels.
8	We'll have help up to you real soon.
8	You're becoming an important man, John.
8	Miss Roffe, could I have a word with you in private?
8	How many other generals can boast the favor and support of a leader... so gifted in the arts of war?
8	We got the room booked for the whole morning.
8	Let's try to figure the whole thing out.
8	Don't be afraid.
8	I'll be right there.
8	Now, stop distracting me. Bye, Stella.
8	Oh yeah.
8	I'd never fuck with you, because I really love you guys.
8	I'll be the man.
8	He's right.
8	A light beer with a twist for my friend.
8	It had to be total and it had to be honest.
8	They're rather fond of me.
8	It's all right.
8	Aye, sir.
8	Thanks for getting me out of purgatory.
8	He's seeing his mistress there.
8	A pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler... money is never an end in itself but simply a tool, as language is to thought.
8	They came to help.
8	All right, thank you, gentlemen.
8	Don't be hard on yourself.
8	I'm sorry for what happened.
8	They ain't gonna quit on me.""
8	Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.
8	You're my hero.
8	I sure don't.
8	And... and don't forget, you're not just eating for one.
8	Badly I want you.
8	Aye, aye, sir.
8	It's a pleasure to do business with a man like you.
8	You know, there's no alcohol in water.
8	They think you can do it.
8	Thank you for stopping, you saved my life!
8	And that's the way it was.
8	This is my team.
8	I told him it was important.
8	Give encouragement to our lives.
8	You admire the son of a bitch.
8	But no more odd, surely, than my driving away that day, away from her, knowing that, inevitably, we would meet again.
