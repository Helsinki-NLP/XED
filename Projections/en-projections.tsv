Look who's here.	7
- Stop mumbling.	1
- Does anything ever happen here?	1
No, no pictures.	1, 4
Everything these days is pictures.	3
- What about after you finish up?	2
On the weekends we go out and have a ball.	5
You just go.	1, 6, 8
After all week it builds up... The idea is to have a ball.	2, 5
Hey Pops, give me one of those crazy beers.	2
Hey, can I help you?	2, 5
Hey, these are keen!	7
Johnny, get a load of this.	2

- You want to go?	2
You won something, did you?	2, 7
That's a nice souvenir to have.	5
Out there, you got me a little wrong.	7
I've got a job to do, but I'm not hard to get along with.	8
Dig that hat, daddy-o.	8
What are you doing tonight?	2
Hi, sweetheart.	5, 8
I've been looking for you all over, hoping you were dead.	3
You do look pale.	6
Are you taking care of yourself?	4
That's better, Johnny. I missed you.	5, 8
Ever since the club split up, I missed you. We all missed you.	6
Go steal one someplace for yourself.	8
Get up, you big hero.	1
- What are they fighting about?	1
- They don't know themselves.	6, 7
Nothing but talk.	3
How about we go and have a...	5
- Shut up! - I want out of here.	1
Break it up. Break it up.	1, 4

- Let me talk to you. - Break it up.  Move along.	1, 6
What did this boy do that frogface didn't do? Johnny, I want to talk to you.	1
Don't let that cop get away with this.	1, 3
- I'll see you later, okay?	5
He was afraid of losing his job.	4
He's the town joke, and I'm stuck with him.	1, 6
He shouldn't be a cop.	6, 7
- Johnny, are we leaving?	7
- Johnny, let's go spring Chino.	2
I'll see if I can get through.	4, 8
Help! - Hello...	4
Hey, Chino.	2
Come on, get up.	1
Sleep well.	5, 8
- Let's go give that cop a bad time.	1, 2, 3, 5
- Maybe she has a sister.	2, 7
The phone is dead.	6
Send somebody for the militia.	4
Let me try.	1, 2, 5
I guess you're right.	5
- Go tell your dad I need him.	2
Remember the night? The first time I went scrambling with the Rebels.	5
Please, Johnny.	2, 4, 6
- You're doing all right.	8
- Wait till somebody gets killed?	1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- I'm gonna use it.	2
Let's get hold of this Johnny before the others do.	1
Guys, look!	2, 5
- Hey!	1, 2, 3, 5, 8
The chick! - Johnny's girl!	2
Let's get her!	2, 4
You're afraid of me.	4
I'm afraid of you?	4
Come on, get on.	1
The way I thought it might be.	8
Why do you hate everybody?	1, 6, 7, 8
I'm gonna leave.	1
He'd like me and take me with him.	8
You were going to give me that statue.	2, 6
It's crazy.	3
I'm shaky.	4, 6
- Storm the bastille!	1, 2, 4
There he comes!	2, 5, 7
Dad, they've got Johnny.	4, 6
- There isn't anything to do.	6
He was trying to stop it.	4
- He got what he wanted.	7
They've got Johnny.	4
I saw it coming, but what could I do?	6
- Shut up.	1
Hold on, there.	2, 7
- Get away from that boy.	4
We're all old friends.	5
That's him!	1, 2
Let's go.	2
How did this get started?	1
Round up everybody on a motorcycle.	2
I knew someone would get killed, but nobody listened.	1, 4, 6
Bring her in later.	1, 4
- You better talk to her now.	1, 3
- Art here saw her fighting him off.	1
- Tell me what?	7
They got you off the hook for a while.	5, 8
I think you're stupid.	1, 3
Don't you want to say anything to these people?	1, 2
The fun is over.	6
You've got ten minutes to clear out.	1
Stick your nose back in this county, and you'll never see daylight again.	4
All dead, you mean!	1
I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow And lived to tell about it.	7
Ka-rumph! We were smashed to port.	1, 7
And it's a miracle old Billy's alive today.	5, 7
Ooh, its breath was like a furnace!	7
Boiled down for his oils, lads, There'd be free grog for all hands!  If we could swallow it on top of his...	5
Come on, Casey. This is no place for a clergyman's son.	1, 3
Let's shove off!	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Oh, professor... just a moment.	7
Yes?	2, 7
You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?	1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
I'm not denying anything.	1
Hey, what are you drawing there?	2
Now put the wings on it.	8

"Well, we'd been scouting for what is called delicately ""a new face."""	2
By most standards, flying all the way to Madrid to look for a new face would seem like going to a lot of trouble.	1, 7
Well, maybe she could dance one more time, just for tonight, huh?	2, 5
Well, why you not make her dance more?	2, 5
Maybe going on the wagon makes a man dull.	3
Could be.	2
The fact that you don't drink at all, Kirk, is the greatest argument for drunkenness I know.	1, 2, 5
You can't buy people's souls.	1, 3
He'd trade his soul to the devil in return for that one moment of real happiness.	8
Can you ever imagine Kirk being in a spot like that?	7
We flew from Rome in your private plane, remember?	2
One of the waiters tells me she's got quite a reputation for not mingling.	7, 8
I'm not required to do your public relations.	1
Now, this is as good a time as any, Harry, to get our relationship straight once and for all.	1, 2
Senorita? Your bare feet are showing.	3, 6
The man with the sweat was more pleasant than you.	3
He is the owner of Texas.	7, 8
And now, he wants to buy me?	2
Did you not once direct Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard?	2, 7
How did you know my name?	7
You didn't think I was dead, too, did you? Maria.	1, 7
He had to go back to work.	6
Here, at least, I'm a little star.	6, 8
Why should I take the chance that I lose it?	7
Do all directors come to ask young women to sit with their producers? Um, not all.	7
I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance.	3, 6
We certainly are, senorita, because we understand you got a lot of talent.	2, 5
And that's the one thing that can make Mr. Kirk Edwards fly all the way here from Rome.	2
Naturally, Mr. Edwards will pay all your expenses while you're being tested.	8
I would not like to have my mother with me.	1
Because I do not like my mother.	3
I'm sure you don't mean that.	6
We can work all that out later, too.	2
The point is, the miracle has happened and a great career is yours for the asking.	5
He's got all those.	8
One of the many troubles with you, Harry, is, you never know where your movie scripts leave off and life begins.	3
Ah, Muldoon, you're a charmer.	5, 7, 8
She never even went back to the room.	6
Without you, Harry.	6
Just cable your agent collect, if you've still got an agent.	3
Right now, I wish it had been.	3, 6
I'm sorry.	3, 6
Help yourself.	1, 3, 5, 8
It's good you no understand my mother. It's liar.	1, 3, 6
My brother took all your cigarettes? I have another pack.	1, 6, 7, 8
I do not like Mr. Kirk Edwards.	1
Mr. Dawes, do you think really that I could be a star?	7
I think that I'm pretty enough, but I would not want to be that kind of star.	6, 7
Therefore, owing to circumstances which, believe me, are beyond my control, I hereby advise you not to come to Rome to make the test.	3
Six months or so ago, I fell in love with one of them.	5
Script girl.	7
She has the name of a man.	7
But when the sick one is yourself, you cannot run away.	6
When I was a little girl, like so many others, there was no money to buy shoes for me,	6
I needed it.	5
I still need it when I'm afraid, like a baby who needs a light on in the dark.	3, 4, 6, 8
You surprise me, Mr. Dawes.	7
What are you afraid of?	8
In the dirt, it's hard to tell.	2
Then, you'll want to say goodbye.	6
I am ready, Mr. Dawes.	2
You've seen it and read it a thousand times.	3
Now, just a minute, gentlemen.	4
In the first place, this young lady is under exclusive contract to Mr. Kirk Edwards, of course, and he cannot discuss her future availability at this time.	2
I was, up to the minute I saw this test.	1
I'm flying to Paris tonight, Harry.	2
I know the answer.	2
Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too, or maybe he doesn't want to know.	2, 3, 6, 7
We got the room booked for the whole morning.	2, 5, 8
It won't take that long.	8
But what I tell Maria to do, she will do.	1, 8
All right, let's go back to Hollywood and make this movie.	2
But you'll never find another Maria.	6
If ever a funeral laid an egg, that one did.	3
Well, it figured. It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her.	5, 8
Not my book, anyway.	1
The columns and the wolves were after me night and day.	4
You could tell it was for real, because they never even gave out interviews about getting married.	8
Kirk didn't even look at me.	7
Everybody's mother's got to die sometime.	6
Mr. Muldoon, it seems that Maria's mother was murdered by Maria's father.	7
As you know, over here, crime is not exploited to sell newspapers.	1, 5
And we're finished playing the key cities.	1
Boss, you think of everything.	8
Bingo. You've got a right to open your collar, take off your shoes and relax in Las Vegas for the rest of your life.	2
It'll make you cry.	1
Montague, if there's one thing I know about, it's Mr. John Q. Public.	5
He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at.	6, 7
Oscar, the phone!	1, 2
Hello!	2, 5
No. This is Oscar.	7
Oh, you just left her?	6, 7
Fine, fine. Say, Harry, something kind of important has come up...	6
I say, something kind of important has come up.	2
Her father murdered her mother.	3, 6, 7
She's flying straight to Madrid to be with her father?	7
How could you let her do a thing like this? What?	2, 7
What kind of an answer is that against a $10 million world gross? You don't say.	7
Remember that in the years ahead when you're directing cigarette butts on television!	1
Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need.	6, 8
You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for.	2
You could tell just by looking at him that half the time he didn't know where he was.	7
And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances, the way he kept admitting over and over that he killed the old lady.	1, 3
Things started to pick up for the home team when Maria's brother, a ganef if ever I saw one, took the stand.	2
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times, and how, on the night of the murder, she not only smashed his radio but hit him.	1, 3, 4, 6
She told about a mother who was full of hate, and how she got back the hate she gave.	6
Self-defense.	4
You're beginning to realize maybe the public knows more about public relations than you do.	5
Two good and happy years, for me at any rate. The night he fell to Earth,	5
Just about a year ago in Beverly Hills, California. It was quite a night.	5
But it soon became obvious that the senor was only mildly interested in the available talent.	1, 6
That dated us, all right, but it gave us something to do.	2
We were worried about Maria.	4
He didn't like it.	6, 7
To Oscar, Alberto Bravano was heaven-sent:	5, 8
So far so good, senor.	5
Certain camps where the men aren't paid enough or fed enough or protected against disease enough.	6, 7
Is it not fortunate, for instance, that I own the newspapers in my country?	5
You throw double sixes again, and I'll have you burned for a witch.	1, 2
He owes me $187,000 and won't pay up.	1, 3, 7
You won't take my check. I'll say.	1
Double six. Ouch.	7
The last time this witch went to a party, she made the princess prick her finger with a spindle and fall asleep for 100 years.	1, 2
Nice party.	5
Nice questions you ask.	2, 5, 8
Yeah.	2, 3, 5, 7, 8
What is with you? What goes with you?	1, 3
If not Kirk, who is it?	7
Shut up.	1
Of course I wouldn't.	1
A glamour girl who does not even smoke.	3
You worked hard.	8
I should stay where I belong.	6
Probably not.	1, 3
I have a coach not pulled by four horses, but with the power of 200.	5
Did it ever occur to you, Harry, that the prince looked everywhere for Cinderella just so that he could put the shoe back on her foot?	1
Now that you mention it...	7
You cannot rent a prince.	1
I've seen him!	7
The fairy tale again.	1
a man you can look at in the daytime.	5
Just because it is big and white and a yacht, is it not still dirt?	1, 3, 7
Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry, but I...	1, 4, 6, 7
I sure pity the people that have to breathe in the daytime.	3
Maybe he'd better start carrying his own matches. Oh?	7
You're going to love International Cafe Society.	5
You got him hooked?	2, 7
I got him sold, Harry.	5
You're a liar!	1
You're a liar.	1
This is most evil of all.	3, 4, 8
And as for taxes, how many millions have you in tax-exempt bonds and oil wells, whose power of production your government so generously protects, while it denies similar benefits to the human brain?	3
My life is none of your business.	1, 3
Why don't you shut up and go back where you came from?	1
So are you, but I admit it openly.	1
I will not go back where I came from, because I do not like it there.	1
I beg your pardon? I leave tomorrow morning for Cannes.	1
Tell him you're not going, tomorrow morning or ever.	6
Clear everybody out!	2
Just this once, Kirk, why don't you empty your own ashtrays?	1, 3
You heard what I said.	1, 2
You said the party's over.	1
Tell everybody to go home.	1
For four years, and now it's over. For four years, I've invited the guests and bought the favors and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests.	3, 6
She'll never make another picture.	1, 6
I'll keep her off the screen. I'll destroy her.  No.	1
Why not destroy senor Bravano?	2
I'll drive you home.	8
Don't I remember you from somewhere?	7
Harry. Remember how you used to say life wrote lousy scripts?	2
Even in one of yours, I would have thrown this glass at him.	1
I'm going home with him instead.	5
You want to know the... What do you call it?  Motivation?	2
I'm a frightened tramp.	4
She was wearing them tonight.	7
Some things you just don't tell anybody.	1, 3, 4, 6
If it would have helped, I'd have yelled it in the streets.	1
There she was, the world's number one symbol of desirability, on display all over the world's number one showroom, with the world's number one customers wanting to buy, and nobody wrapped her up and took her home.	4, 7
I'll swear that into my own grave.	3
It's as if ordinary human beings, living ordinary lives, had suddenly vanished from the Earth, and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people.	7
They are all happy all the time.	5
She never asks for money, but somehow she always happens to help grateful rich people.	3
Hector Eubanks was the fireball of our little cocoon.	5, 8
Any more than I could on that night I saw Maria for the last time.	6
You write the long word on top of the page, and under it, you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one.	2, 8
You know something? Off the screen, I don't think I've ever seen you laugh before.	7
No, not tonight.	3
To begin with, a thief.	3
You've cost me millions and millions of francs.	1, 3, 6
A dead animal!	4, 7
He's less a gigolo than anyone in our immediate company.	8
My champagne is not properly cooled.	3
A really distinguished family...	6
A universal cure.	8
Of all directions, why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and Cannes?	1
But no more odd, surely, than my driving away that day, away from her, knowing that, inevitably, we would meet again.	8
Maybe you can talk this over later in private, maybe.	4
I do not know what you are, but you are not a woman.	3
Once you had the look for me of an exquisite lady.	5
What is your work?	2
You have no way of knowing the way that I think.	1
Oh, I think not.	1, 7
I left my home simply because I had to leave.	6
But I will not attempt one here and now.	6, 7
For the first time, when we looked at each other in the gypsy camp, and again at the window at the casino, and again just now, when I held out my hand to you,	5, 8
The sword was her husband's.	8
My own husband was killed in this last war.	6
I admire this gentleman.	2, 8
Do you approve?	2
It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is.	3, 7
Then you don't approve.	1
That to marry Maria would be the most senselessly cruel and destructive thing you will ever have done?	1, 4, 7
It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis to get off the world.	1, 3
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child.	4
The world will someday see paintings of her. And of her and me.  And then it will think,	2, 5
Have you thought for a moment about her?	1, 3
Have you thought for a moment about anybody else but yourself, and your obsession with 14 letters of the alphabet arranged in a hyphenated name?	1
Especially when there are no days and nights in it, but just days that turn black when the sun goes down.	6
Perhaps I have become, as you put it, obsessed by our name and our past, and the absence of our future, and by our paintings.	1, 4, 6
It has happened to me without my wanting, almost without my knowing.	3
The bride on whom the rain doth fall.	5
Sends her love.	5, 8
I'm behaving like 13 years old.	3
Don't kid yourself.	1
As if all my life I had lived in a dark place, and all at once the lights went on.	5
No. Never in my life have I been more sure of myself, and of everything else.	8
How can I?	6
What will I tell you? That he is handsome and tall, and good and kind, and proud and so on?	3
"I say I cannot play a scene, and you say, ""Play it."""	1
How do you mean that? And now you will laugh.	6, 7
Standard opening. And now, you are being deliberately stupid.	1, 3
Is that all right with you?	2
I've told you that he is what other men are not.	5, 8
Oh, no, no, no. I want to hear more about this.	2, 7
Looking back,	6
Won't you change your mind and stay for dinner, Mr. Dawes?	2
We'd be pleased if you would.	2, 5
I'm giving the bride away.	8
I do not know who plays the violin. Paganini.	2, 4
Oh, and that's as it should be.	5
And they're having more fun.	6
What makes you think we're living in this day and age?	1, 2
Emotionally, she's a child.	1
She's wrapped all her adolescent dreams up in one dream prince, and you're it.	2, 4, 7
I don't want her hurt at all.	4, 5, 8
Do you think I do?	1
Oh, I don't know.	6
It's not going to be easy.	4
What is not going to be easy?	3, 6, 7
I saw her just once more after that wedding night.	6
Are you happy to see me?	2, 5
It was fine. You've been away all this time?	7
No, I have not been away all that time.	6
It's just me.	7
and on my wedding night, to wait for him with my heart full of love.	2
This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you.	5, 6, 8
You find it hard to believe that this is not just a dream you dreamed a long time ago.	2
that we were never to be apart again.	5, 8
But inevitably, there comes a time for waking up, even for us.	2
You are everything I would want as my wife.	5, 8
I would want no one else.	2, 5, 8
As for the rest of what I have to say, you will find it neatly typed at some length, on this piece of paper.	8
No.	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Do you understand now why it is so important to me for you to believe that I love you with all of my heart?	5
The chauffeur? The stable boy?	7
That's the unholy pity of it.	6
I can wind this one up in six weeks.	5
I'm going to make him happy.	2, 5
Why even tell me about it? Because I needed to tell you!	1
Harry, what do you think would make Vincenzo happy?	2
That would only make him less unhappy.	5
This time it is you who does not understand. I know Vincenzo better than you do.	1
How much simpler it would be, for so many of us, if Kirk Edwards had not found it necessary to look for a new face.	1
It will be difficult for me. Suppose...	4
Do you know any Spanish?	2
Today you are full-fledged ensigns.	2, 5, 8
From here on, your education must continue in the school of war.	1, 3
As an ensign in the United States Navy. - - You go down to the sea to fight in the toughest conflict of all time.	8
- Congratulations, Willie.	8
Mother, I'll have to skip your party tonight.	3, 6
The fellas are celebrating.	5
- There's a time for everything.	8
- I'm sorry, Willie.	3, 6
I didn't mean to ruin your evening.	6
We can go to the Fairmont...	6
- Meaning what?	1
- I've only got 48 hours.	4
- Willie, don't.	1
If there were more time...	6
I didn't expect you to.	2, 3
I forgot who I was.	7
I don't want any more of it.	1, 2, 3
Your ship's been in lots of battles.	8
You'd better take this extra $100.	8
Promise me you'll be careful.	8
I won't. I promise.  Goodbye, sweetheart.	5, 8
This way, Keith.	2
Watch that enthusiasm. This is the Caine.	1
Your orders.	8
They transform ex-civilians into men without minds.	1
I only hope that you're good enough for the Caine.	2
- I'll try to be worthy of the job.	2, 5
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hours a day to keep her together.	5, 6, 8
- That does it.	1
I'm very fond of my wife and kid.	5
Keith, I'm gonna be sick. I'm sorry.	3, 6
That's darn cordial of you.	5, 7
- It's all right.	5, 8
- The tour was very interesting.	5
- Here we go again.	4
- I didn't know anything about this.	6, 7
- He shouldn't have to decide here.	6
You will live to regret this day.	1, 3
If you stay ten years, you may learn to tell an aircraft from a seagull.	1, 3
Launch sweep gear.	1, 2
You must love that guy to do what you did for him.	7
Go dry yourself, Keith.	1
- Your opinion might be valuable.	8
I forgot about it.	3, 6
- Did you decode the message?	2
- It's incredible stupidity...	1, 6, 7
- Anyone can make a mistake.	8
The margin for error is narrow here.	8
There's too much loss of life and property damage possible.	3, 6
- Is it unfair?	1
- Go ahead, man to man.	1, 2
As you can see, I'm being relieved of command.	1, 2, 6
Feel better?	6
We all have our own ways of running a ship.	8
She ought to be melted down for razor blades.	1, 3
- Request permission to leave. - Captain, sir?	2, 4
- What is it, Meatball?	4
- It's against Navy regulations.	1
I've been aboard the Caine too long.	3, 6
What do you know?	2
Let's get down to cases.	2
Now that I've shot my face off, I'll give you the chance to do the same.	1, 2, 5
The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way and my way.	8
- Captain...	4
But it's happening!	2
You idiot.	1
All engines ahead full.	2
Willie, you look worried.	4, 6
A captain's job is a lonely one.	6
Look what just came in.	7
He's in plenty of hot water.	6
He's about to be boiled in oil.	1, 3, 4
- You didn't expect me to stay away?	7
I'm always delighted to meet Willie's friends.	5
Sure. I'll be right down.	8
- Miss Wynn is going with you?	7
- I do. I like her a lot.	2, 5, 8
- I promise.	4, 8
Goodbye, Mom.	6
- Like a new song.	2, 5
Fun but scary.	4, 5
It was nice of your mother to let you come.	5
- It wasn't up to my mother.	1, 6
Let the fire fall!	5
This is paradise.	5
- Let them look.	8
You have changed.	7
Sometimes I think there's almost a chance for us.	5
- Willie, it's getting late.	1
Have you ordered yet?	8
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?	5, 8
Don't look at me like that.	3
- She won't, and you'll be unhappy.	1, 3
- You couldn't leave your girl?	7
I told him not to expect me to pull the Caine into shape overnight.	1
There will be no further mistakes from the officers and crew.	3, 6
The Navy's waiting for me to make a mistake, but I won't make it.	2, 4
So much for old business.	6
Gentlemen, I have good news for you.	2, 5
Let's straighten up and fly right.	8
Running away? - Don't look for trouble, Tom.	1
- There must be a reason for this.	8
- Thanks, Dad.	5
- Steve, I thought you'd be amused.	2, 7
It's the saga of a man with very little charm and even less courage.	3
Find someone else to sing about.	1
- Old Yellowstain will be flattered.	2
I'm not feeling well. This won't take long.	6
That'll be all, steward.	1
They're rather fond of me.	5, 8
A command is a lonely job. It isn't easy to make decisions.	6
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help... constructive loyalty.	8
We all have ideas of right and wrong. - - But we have to pitch in for the good of the family.	2, 4, 8
If there's anything you want to say, I'll be glad to listen.	8
My headache's much worse.	6
- Don't be so sentimental, Willie.	1
I thought it was a good speech.	5, 6
We could have backed him up.	6
You knew nothing about DeVriess and you know even less about Queeg.	1, 3, 8
I know about abnormal behaviour.	6
He'll snap any day.	4
- Let him.	1, 2
The rolling balls, the second-hand phrases, the migraine headaches... Shirt-tails, and tonight's speech:  I turned yellow but my dog likes me.	6
- I think Tom does make sense.	8
- You stay out of this.	1
So he has migraine headaches and he rolls steel balls. So what?	1, 3
Everybody's a screwball in some way.	2, 3, 5, 6, 8
Will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said?	4, 8
I'm not doing it alone.	4, 6, 7
There'll be no more talk of the captain being crazy.	1, 3
- It can only blow up in our faces.	4
- I still insist he's paranoid.	3
This was calculated disrespect to your commanding officer.	3
There will be no more movies for 30 days.	1
Today, the captain ordered a general drill for the safety of the crew.	2, 8
Many of you aren't wearing battle gear.	6, 7
Stop putting on that gear!	1, 7
Some of you think you can outsmart me.	1, 8
There will be no liberty for three months.	1, 4
I won't be made a fool of.	1
How's it going?	5
- Lay off.	1
- I'm not blind.	1
You must be wondering why I called you here.	2
- Two, sir.	8
- Painter?	7
Jorgensen...?	7
This tureen holds as much sand as we had strawberries tonight.	3, 6
- You mean in the morning?	7
Now, by my watch, does not mean in the morning, but 01:47.	1, 3
- Unsatisfactory.	1, 3
Everybody forgot about it but me.	1, 3
- I never thought of that, sir.	7
It should be fun doing some detective work.	2, 5, 8
Steve, turn me in if you want to. But this is over the line.	1
Steve, are you familiar with Article 184 of Navy regulations?	4
- He swallowed his key.	3
- Good luck, Harding.	8
- Thank you, sir.	5, 8
The mess boys ate the strawberries.	1
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble.	6
I'm happy to get out of this madhouse.	5
I'll call all your wives and girls for you.	2
- The Caine's a floating mistake.	8
- What are you driving at?	1
- They'll never believe us.	1, 4, 6
- Is this record correct or not?	1
Everything there can be interpreted as an attempt to enforce discipline.	1, 3
- Why didn't you tell me before?	1
- If we do this, we're in trouble.	4
I'll risk it.	2, 5
I see six sides to every risk and 12 reasons not to take it.	4
Behind this eloquent exterior, I've got a yellow streak 15 miles wide.	6
- Steve, what do we do now?	2
- Without Tom, I'll get nowhere.	8
- I don't know what Tom is... now.	4
Hurry back.	2, 4
- I suggest that we do.	2
This is the captain speaking.	4
It's difficult holding her.	4
We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind.	6, 7
- Back the starboard engine!	7
If we keep our stern to the wind, we'll roll over.	4
The fleet didn't order us to manoeuvre at discretion.	1, 3
I can't hold the wheel.	6
Captain, back the starboard engine!	4
We'll head into the wind.	2
- Captain, we're in serious trouble.	4
Don't question my decisions again.	1, 3
If you officers know what's good for you, tell them to stop.	1, 3
Willie, I'm worried.	4
- I'll always regret that I didn't.	6
Pleased to meet you.	5
- Are you our lawyer?	2
- I'm a friend of the family.	8
- That's pretty flip.	5
At the moment, you have an excellent chance of being hanged.	7
- Three ships were lost, you know.	6
The Navy has three psychiatrists who will testify that Queeg is sane.	8
I'm a judge of human behaviour.	1, 2
- Would you repeat it in court?	8
That's confusing the issue.	7
I guess I can't blame you.	6
- How do I plead?	4
You're a great naval hero.	8
Myself. When I am in possession of my faculties and Queeg is not.	1, 4
Mr Keith, it's contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.	1, 3
I object.	1
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon?	1, 2
I was plenty scared.	4
- Did you like Captain Queeg?	2
- I liked him, but not a lot.	5, 8
- He acted strange.	7
Did Captain Queeg look sick?	4, 7
For the safety of the ship I obeyed Mr Maryk's order. -	8
Maryk showed me a log he had written on Queeg's behaviour.	7
On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action. - - And that we'd be charged with mutiny.	1, 3
- He's lying.	1, 8
- He'll get you into more trouble.	1, 4
I want one hero, not two mutineers.	1
- How did it go, Tom?	2, 5
Doctor, can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts?	6
Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement. - - Would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him?	2
- Then he was relieved unjustly?	7
My background is legal, not medical. My questions might be elementary.	6
Queeg is not on trial.	1
Objection overruled.	1
- He'd undergone a lot of strain.	6
Inclined to hound subordinates about small details?	1, 2
- That's part of the picture.	8
- I never mentioned any illness.	7
- What kind of personality?	2
I would like to protest the counsel's twisting of words.	1, 3
- That's absurdly hypothetical.	6, 7
The defence has an interesting point.	7
- Absolutely.	5
- He's sure gonna bear down on me.	1
If I had to do it again, I'd do it.	8
- No.	1, 4, 6, 7
- I can't.	1, 6, 7
- I wanted to save the ship.	6
- Isn't the reverse possible?	2, 4
- No more questions.	1
- No further questions.	3
I bear them no malice. I'm sorry for them.	6
My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me about that.	1, 6
Weren't you reprimanding a seaman for having his shirt-tail out. - - While the ship turned 360 degrees?	1, 3
That only took two seconds.	7
- The question is abusive.	3
We assume that no commander of a US naval ship can possibly be a coward.	8
I didn't say that.	1
- Yes.	8
- Yes, I do.	2, 5, 8
The court can't hear you.	4
I request a recess.	7
Have you no recollection of a conversation with Ensign Harding?	2
Didn't he tell you that the mess boys ate the strawberries?	2, 7
There's no need for that.	1
All the officers were disloyal.	1, 3, 6, 7
But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles. -	1, 4
Steve, make them pipe down.	1
Hi, fellas.	5, 8
The officers of the Caine in happy celebration.	5
I had to torpedo him.	3, 6
And I feel sick about it.	3
Tough guys who didn't crack up like Queeg.	8
Queeg endangered the lives of the men.	4
It wouldn't have helped our case.	6
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.	3, 6
I'm asking you, Steve.	2
- If that's true, we were guilty.	2, 4, 6
The Shakespeare whose testimony nearly sunk us all.	3
He never even heard of Queeg.	7
- Let's forget it.	1, 8
Then you thought up this idea.	5
I'm drunker than you are, so it'll be a fair fight.	1
We'd have got married, had a house and children.	6
I shall always think about it.	6
There's a train belonging to my government standing in Yuryatin. There's a carriage for myself and my assistants.	8
There's no question. I'm not going with you.	1
Strelnikov is dead. - What?	7
Do you see how this affects Larissa? You don't?	1
"Indeed throughout the entire interview... he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov which is his right name and refused to answer to the name of ""Strelnikov."""	3
Don't tell Lara this.	4
Now I know exactly what you think of me, and why.	3
- How many? = All of us.  - Sorry, not enough room.	4, 7
It's all right. I'll have to bring our sledge.  Hurry.	2, 5
This train can't wait.	1
Hurry!	1, 2, 4, 7
- He'll never leave Russia. Then let him stay.	1
I'll tell you how I first met your mother.	2, 5
He suffered me to buy him a new suit... and to get him a job at his old hospital.	7
So he never saw her again?	6
But he kept it to himself. He kept a lot to himself.	1, 6
I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.	2, 4, 5, 7
It was disapproved of by the Party.	1
She'd come to Moscow to look for her child. I helped her as far as I could.	5
- Not your father. Komarovsky.	1
He let go of my hand. And I was lost.	4, 6
- Will you think about it? - Yes.	8
It's all right, David.	5, 6, 8
You've promised to think about it.	1, 6
Tonya!	5, 7
Can you play the balalaika? Can she play?	2
Who taught you? No one taught her.	8
While violence cloaks itself in a plethora of disguises, its favorite mantle still remains sex.	3
I'm gonna love squeezing you out.	1
She wears the pants alright, but somehow she always strips her gears.	7
Now! Natural, huh?  You on your back, huh?	1, 2
Alright, knock it off!	1
I've seen better fights on a light show!	1, 3
Let's see who the real chicken is.	2
How could they with you here?	1, 3
These things just are not made for long rides. Nice set of wheels.	5
Do you girls mind if we run some timing trials?	2
You're sure we're not, uh, crowding you, eh?	4
You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor. That's when you hit the magic button.	6
He's such a nut about that car and driving fast...	4
Really?	2, 3, 5, 7
Well then let's have fun, baby.	2
Well, make up a time. You know, a time like you know.	1
But I do, I beat their time.	1
A safety-first Clyde.	5, 8
I think you're all being unfair.	1
Now she makes sense.	8
How 'bout it, handsome?	2, 5
C'mon! Hurry!	2, 5
C'mon Tommy, hurry!	1
Nearly creamed us both.	4, 7
He should, he's got a lot to be thankful for!	1
What's your hurry, honey? He's not gonna run away!	7
Look, I better go!	2
Like Clyde lost control?	7
You won't be needing this anymore and I think your boyfriend's had his gut full of races!	1
That's Tommy's, he values that. He won it!  Good!	5, 7
Now let him win it back!	7
Let's just time Lancelot as he comes charging to the rescue! - What's going on here?	7
Let's have it.	1, 2
The point is of no return... and you've reached it!	1
You can still climb in that kiddie car and take a hike... unless you can fight better than you can drive!	1, 7, 8
You'll kill him, stop!	4
Turn around!	1
Yes sir, the thrill of the open road.	2, 5
New places, new people and new sites of interest.	2, 5
You know, with them new suits they're makin', I bet they helping' the sun tan oil sales... all that skin to cover.	3
Ah, you should have stuffed her in the car with the friend.	6, 7
Oh, you're cute.	8
Tried to save a girl, kind of queered his mind too.	1
Course they gave him a big hunk of money for a settlement. Don't nobody know how much it was.	3
Never has deposited it. Like I say, he's a nut.	3
It's kind of sad, though. All that money and nobody to enjoy it.	6
Just like we're gonna find a big hunk of that long green.	2, 5
Now let's move, but let's take the back door.	2, 4
Cool it! Or you're gonna get the same thing your boyfriend got.	1, 2
Boy, that old character mut be a kook.	4
All that bread and livin' in a dump like this. Smashed cars, busted-out buses... but all good stashes.	6
You'll go too far.	1, 4, 6
He forgets easy what that money cost me.	1, 3
Wh... what do you want me to do, pa? Git another girl?	4
You were too rough the last time!	1
We're payin' 'em back, boy.	1, 2
Ain't no doubt about your gender, girly.	2
The question is what are you doing here?	1
Then again, you never can tell.	7
Why do you bother with her, eh? She's nothing but trouble.	6
I'm gonna take the gag out.	1, 2
What're you gonna do with me?	4
All I wanna do is go home.	2
Oh god, I promise I won't say anything.	4
I'll tell them anything!	4
- Oh, I needed that.	2, 5
So what happens now, eh?	2
That old man is a sick character.	3, 8
The less the girl hears, the better.	4
That isn't exactly living it up.	3, 6
You girls a bunch of nudists? Or you just, uh, short of clothes?	3
You get around on those wheels pretty good.	2, 7, 8
She flipped and tried to kill herself.	6, 7
Sort of takin' the long way, aren't ya?	4
Bringin' her home in the middle of the night wouldn't help anybody, especially her.	1
I wouldn't want anybody to think I wasn't hospitable.	1
I don't trust him.	6, 7
Look around, dummy. You see any wires?	3
Knock it off!	1
- Jack and Jill. They make the mafia look like Brownies.	1
And we know how to do that, don't we boy?	8
We got to save her!	4
Yeah, he does a lot of that.	5
I gotta stay with her.	8
C'mon, rest awhile girl.	4, 6
Ten percent of your action be enough for anyone.	8
I don't know what you're training' for, but as far as I'm concerned, you're ready. Look!	5, 8
Now why don't you drop that tree you're holding and let's grab a vine and swing a little, huh?	2
What the hell was that? !	4
She nearly tried to kill me!	1, 3
Yeah, we got unfinished business! Her and me.	1
Thank you for stopping, you saved my life!	5, 8
Of course I'll help you.	5, 8
Don't you understand? !	1
They're vicious killers! Wait a minute!	4
Who are vicious killers?	4, 7
Those girls! Wild drivers, sports cars!	5, 7
How long has she been gone? !  How long?	1, 4
He can help us.	8
But I just escaped from here! Don't you understand?	1
You're wasting yourself on this kid, then hanging us up for nothing.	1
Now she's going back today, soon as we give 'em a full stomach to travel on.	5
Where's brother? Lookin' for that girl yet, I reckon.	8
Oh, he ain't alone.	2, 4, 7
I'll buy you one. C'mon, we've got our own schedule to meet.	5
You better straighten your tie, Samson! Or poppa'll spank you!	1, 3
The water's great!	5
You oughtta try it, it might clear your head.	5
What's that got to do with it?	7
Ghosts!	4
And runnin' late as usual.	1
You proud to have that animal for kin?	1, 3
What he could be is your son. Yeah, he's my seedling'...	7
Alright, have it any way you want!	1, 3
Well if you don't see it, we ain't got it.	4, 8
Everything we're gonna be eatin' is on this table.	8
When it's gone we're done feeding'. - Pass the chicken.	2
Alright son, start passing' that chicken 'fore it loses its juice!	2, 5, 8
You done real good, son.	5, 7, 8
He cooks better than his ma!	7, 8
She's not really thinking...	1, 3
You're kinda that type yourself.	1
Quiet types interest me.	5
Are you really that quiet?	3
I like men with big appetites....	8
But then, uh.... You look to me like a gal with a big appetite for everything.	4
- I'm glad for the company.	5
What'll we drink to?	2
He must keep you on overtime.	4
You haven't touched a thing.	1
Uh, it's an interesting case.	7
I'd appreciate your advice before we leave.	2, 8
Oh, well I'm no psychiatrist.... She looks to me like she needs professional help.	4, 6
She'll kill you! She killed him!	4
She will! You're listening to a sick girl!	1, 3, 4
Oh, she did!	5, 7
He killed when he was born... without knowin' it.	4, 6
Whaddya trying' to do, make it a short day?	1
That's why I do things... to feel good.	5
You really should be AM and FM...	6, 7
You're a fool, you're bagged-out with sauce.	1, 3
It's home....	8
You hate him....	6, 7
And I want you.	5, 8
Badly I want you.	5, 8
What's weak about wanting?	7
Just do it.	1, 2, 8
Move it, boy!	1
which makes twice today.	1
Somethin' wrong with your car?	2, 4, 6, 7
Your little playmate's gone, and I suggest we do the same.	1
C'mon Kirk, we gotta find her before the old lech does.	1
We don't wanna miss her, boy, we wanna get there first.	2
Not necessarily, this country plays tricks with the eyes.	1, 6
My father tried to help her.	6
They both fell.	6
Just like before!	2
Cover up her mouth!	1
Go on boy!	2, 5
Now there's a thought....	2
He's of no use to no one, including himself.	1, 3
That's what you're living with, a couple of real boy scouts!	1
I'm.. I no m..mean to.	4
I'm... I'm sorry.	6
Easy, brother.	7
You're doin' fine, you're doin' just fine.	8
Nothing's... ever right.	6
You're gonna be alright.	8
I love everybody?	5, 8
It's over now, nobody's hurt!	5
He'll have to be committed....	2
Too much time!	4
Come on, Linda.	2
It ain't all that easy, son....	6
I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys.	1, 2
Old man, give me the keys!	1
You can rot for all I care.	3
You too, buster, no sense in us all goin' noble.	1
I'll take the scenic route by foot.	2
Alright, c'mon son, let's get movin'.	2
I don't aim to have that threesome prowling' my property no longer.	1
Alright, here's how it works....	2, 5
I'll take my chances with the gas.	2
Give it to me!	1
Much later, Billie!	3
Besides, this desert climate's not too good on a girl's complexion.	6
collect the scratch! - What about him?	2, 7
Go on! Go back and get the knife!	1, 4
It's not right to leave it in there.	3, 4, 6
My brother must've found the keys.	4, 8
That's strange, my brother can't drive like that.	7
It's her!	4, 5, 7
We've really gotta make tracks or we're dead! C'mon!	4
Your old man's been blasted out of his wheels. And your king-sized brother's been twisted like a pretzel.	3
I don't believe it!	1
I killed her! I killed her like she was an animal.	2, 3, 4, 6
A real Jekyll and Hyde.	3
Hey you saved my life, so stop crying, huh?	5
- Halt!	1, 2
The ring!	7
- The preparations for my departure...	6, 8
Without the ring, there will be no sacrifice, without the sacrifice, no congregation.	8
- I don't like to.	6
Lovely lads and so natural.	2, 5, 8
She had my finger, you know...	6
It's cold.	6
- So, the ring? - No.	1
How about this, Shufti?	2
Gold!	2, 5, 7
- It is not the one.	6
Oh...	6
- Well, you're very polite.	1
- Ho, ho! - Ho!  - Ho, ho, ho!	5
- Don't look at me.	1, 4
- Very nice.	1, 5
Ostentatious, that is!	2, 5, 7
Argh! Kaili!	1
Oh!	1, 7
Excuse me...	1, 4
There's a man down there on his head.	4
Arthur?	7
- I can say no more.	6
If he is to be sacrificed before Kaili, why is he not painted red?	7
And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.	2, 4, 7
- You have till five o'clock.	3
You are lucky to be chosen!	1, 2
- What's this?	7
Come off!	1, 2
Here, you have a go.	2
We have lots of little problems like this.	3
- Therefore, it must be a metal.	4
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?	1
Early days yet, sir.	1, 2
There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here. My life is in danger.  Three ten.	4
- You've failed.	1, 3, 6
- What kind? Your tools are broken.	4, 6, 8
This won't work.	6
It could work if the government would spend more money.	6
He's an idiot.	1
Good British plugs.	2, 5, 8
- I used to use my hands.	6
He used to use his hands.	6
Stop it!	1, 3
It's more than my job's worth!	1, 7
Outrageous!	1
You're nothing but a mad scientist!	1, 3
With a ring like that I could, dare I say it, rule the world.	2, 5
Get your hands off him or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!	1
- I must have this ring.	1, 2
MIT was after me, wanted me to rule the world for them.	1, 3
They trust me.	8
How do you know we can trust her? She's had your fingers before, Ringo.	4
Well, that was a mistake. I can vouch for her.	8
- Lasers ready.	2, 8
- Get them!	1, 2, 7, 8
Just give me five minutes.	2
- You can put that away.	1
From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring.	1
Alas, if he were brave this would not be necessary.	3, 6
Where've you been?	2
You're as bad as your sister, coming home from work at all hours and colours.	1, 3
I wouldn't think of such a thing!	7
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.	6
Don't look right or left.	4
They might take us for innocent bystanders.	4
Go!	1, 2
Kaili...	1
- Sorry, I hit him.	3, 6
Get Off!	1
- It's me, you fool.	1, 3, 5
Well, stop it!	1, 3, 5
Feet! Feet, you fool!	1
Withdraw!	4, 5
Had to do all this myself...	1
- Paul?	7
- Look, what you've done.	3, 7
- Hey, is that Paul?	3, 7
What are you doing here?	2, 4, 7
If I had a Luger...	1
The remedy is in your hands...	8
Ah, the ring!	7
There they are!	5
Wait!	2, 4, 7
The blood's rushing to my head.	1, 4
I've got it...	2
Steady.	4
That's what comes of teaching science by TV.	3, 6, 7
- Hurry up!	2
That was good.	5
Run, Ringo!	4
- Get on!	1
My blood group is very unusual. Look!	2
Please... No...	4
I am very busy... please!	3, 4
- I'm in fear of my life, you know.	4
- It's for you, the famous Ringo.	2, 5, 8
We're not all masochists.	3, 6
We need protection.	8
- I need protection.	4
Ugh! Shocking!	3, 4, 7
Roger, Ahme.	8
I will complete the task. Out.	1, 8
- We're being attacked!	7
Run!	4
- Stop!	4
You can do it!	5, 8
In here! Quickly!	2
- Fire!	4
- Left!	1
You naughty boys.	1, 3
There must be somewhere in England where one can find sanctuary to think.	1, 3
You're light again, George.	2, 5, 7
- How do you know it's not you.	2, 5, 7
- You want to chuck one in?	2
- Like an old boot.	3
See, that didn't hurt.	5
- Will you hold this drumstick?	2, 5
- Manchester has a good drummer.	2, 5, 8
I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates.	5, 8
So the police are extended giving the famous protection, for which we are justly proud in this country, for a finger, eh?	6, 7
What's that...	4
We won't leave this palace alive.	6
- I beg your pardon?	1, 7
Hands up!	1, 2
Quick!	1, 2, 4
- Quick! Quick!	1, 2, 7
This should work, it's from Harvard.	8
Quickly!	2, 4, 7
After them! After them!	1, 2
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?	2
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?	2
I'm always getting winked at these days.	7
Oh, Sorry Ringo.	7
All the rungs have been neatly sawn in the middle.	5
- Your famous Ringo is safe.	2, 5
Oh, here you are...	6, 7
- So it is!	8
- Don't worry, he's harmless.	8
- Why didn't you think of that?	1, 6, 7
Come on! Come on!	2
- Where are we going?	2
- Never you mind.	1, 6
- Thank you very much.	8
You should have thought of that before you left the house.	1
- OK.	8
- Is that it?	6, 7
Clang had the whole temple transported here for your sacrifice.	1
Very nice of him, though.	5, 7
- They'll disembowel us.	4
Oh, feet!	5
The things we have to do in these heathen countries. There must be an easier way to set a trap!	1, 3
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.	3
You've got the part, Paul.	5, 7
- It's on the map as being here.	1
- This isn't a temple, is it?	1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
He's a bit soft that Inspector, isn't he?	7
- Typical!	1
He's mine!	5
Help!	4, 5, 7
There's one on the back, but it's not the right one.	6
This is no time for foolish tricks!	1, 2
Now, this will get him!	1
Never mind.	1
- That's done it, he's gone.	1
- I can't start the car.	1, 6, 7
On, on!	2
On!	2
I've got a plan.	2, 5
Ringo!	1, 5, 7
" Ringo!
da/1965/59260/6777980.xml.gz	en/1965/59260/6208054.xml.gz	996	1283	- Ringo!	 Ringo!"	5
All right, talk!	1, 2
- I'm a perfect surgeon.	1, 2, 5
Alas... Scalpel.	1, 2
You wouldn't want me to go in with a blunt scalpel.	5
- A Webley automatic...	7
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home, for England!	5
The government in the palm of my hand.	2
' NOW!	1
- Wait till my mates get you.	4
They're quite merciless.	4
No!	1, 4, 5, 6, 7
I'm saved!	5
I just showed courage. - How many fingers you got left?	2
- I'm beginning to like it.	2, 5
He who wears the ring... ♪ Help!	4, 5
That's me! '	2, 5
I'm gonna put a stop to this.	1, 2
- I love you.	5, 8
"- I just said, ""I love you."""	1
- Yes, ma'am?	2, 8
Come on in.	2, 8
I'm awake, Leary.	5
Oh.	7
- Well, then, bacon and eggs for me.	2
In case it slipped your mind, it's gunnery stations at 0830.	3
One more scratch on it and your career in the Navy is ended.	1, 2, 3
I'm obsolescing like this old straw-bottomed cruiser of ours.	6
I got a ship to run.	5, 8
I'll put in for a transfer.	2
- Might not get another chance.	6
I'm sorry, Rock.	6
- Anything interesting?	2
- I got a run of three.	5
I got that Hawaiian Sea Frontier dispatch decoded.	5
- More fun and games?	1
Splendid, thank you, sir.	5
The pilots are up early for squadron exercises.	2
Why aren't they over Diamond Head?	7
I don't like it, Paul.	3
This is not a drill.	1
- What?	1, 2, 7
Japs!	4
Man your battle stations!	2
- Aye, sir.	8
- Screw the captain.	1
- 20 knots through the harbour?	7
Let us board!	5
Stop!	1, 4
If they does, I'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again!	1, 2, 8
Advise me of any further messages.	2
The battleships, man!	2
- 12 bat-blind ships.	7
- We have no choice.	6
It could give us time to bring our carriers within range.	2
- Thank you, Admiral Broderick.	5
nan	1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Aye, aye, sir.	2, 5, 8
She's empty.	7
At this rate, we'll have to head home inside 10 hours.	2, 3
- That'd be an invitation to enemy subs.	2
There may be subs out there, maybe not.	1, 7
We haven't enough fuel to hold the keel down.	4
- Midship damage control won't answer.	4
- What's wrong?	7
Eddington said to tell the old man - I'm sorry, sir, the captain - that he'd better start thinking about a tow.	4
Nice work, Harding.	5
Thank you, sir.	5
- Where is he?	7
"Did I hear ""Lieutenant Junior Grade""?"	1, 7
Can you pass some portable pumps to us?	2
Can do, sir.	8
I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that.	6, 7
Soon they'll make admirals out of captains with guts.	1
It must be a mistake, he was clever...	6, 7
- Two rings... purse.	7
He was my only boy, and I love him so much.	5, 6, 8
You don't have a boy!	1
- Been here long?	2
- Sorry, nothin' but beer.	6
Martial law.	4
Will you see my clothes are packed and sent over to the bachelors officers' quarters?	2, 8
Can I help you with that?	2
This is yours, sir.	8
Lousy.	3
The X-rays will be along shortly.	2, 8
That's a real nice sound to wake up to.	5
Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances.	1, 3, 6
I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them.	1, 3
Hey, look at you!	5
- Shall we celebrate?	2, 5
There's some action at a place in Moanalua.	2
No, no parties for me.	1, 6
Anyway, when do you special intelligence officers do what you're supposed to do?	1
No, no thanks.	1
Who's our host?	2
It's very important to relax, old boy.	5
- How do you do?	5
- Enjoying the party, Captain Torrey?	1
Not exactly funny, it's just that you're so different from your son.	7
I think she's about to fall in love with him.	2, 5
- I hope so.	4
Not much comfort.	6
I made a special effort to not look like a nurse.	2, 7
I'm flying under false colours, Miss Haynes.	3, 6
I don't have to get any place but out. Share a cab?	2, 8
Thank you, Miss Haynes.	8
I'm Maggie... if you'd like to be less formal.	8
My unit's due to be shipped out soon.	6
I'm Ensign Torrey, sir.	4, 7
- Very well, sir.	8
- You disapprove, sir?	6, 7
- What's your duty, sir?	2
I expect to be in the forward areas, if not actually in combat.	2
And for Broderick.	8
With a little left over for Neal Owynn?	2
- Is it important?	2
I can't tell you about it.	4, 8
- That's where I got it.	2, 5
I'd like to meet him, Rock.	2
No, you wouldn't.	7
The women have to move before it's too late.	2
Suppose they meet?	4
- Hello, Ensign.	2
You're more than welcome to bring her, or him, along.	5
- That's very gracious of you.	5, 7
- You run a taut ship.	3, 4
- Please!	4
- Did you say Army?	2
- He wasn't much of a man.	3
- This cutter's broken.	6
Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't.	7
That's quite a knife you carry.	4
What do you skin?	2
- Just married.	5
- That the best you can do?	1, 3
- Brandy for me.	5
- I was just an ensign.	6
I fell over my feet most of the time.	5, 6, 7
When I came back from the war, I had a son.	2, 5, 7
And the Cunliffes had great plans for me.	2
It was quite a scene.	2
And that's the way it was.	4, 8
You were terribly in love with her.	5, 6, 8
And you look lovely in the candlelight.	5
- I don't think so.	1, 2
- What's the matter?	2, 4, 6
I don't like this, any of it.	4
- Think I'm an idiot?	1, 7
- I have not!	1, 4, 6, 8
I just don't fit behind a desk, I I'm not cut out for it, I feel dry-docked.	3, 6
- Thanks, fellas.	5, 8
CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact.	2, 8
From any of those islands, he could launch a strike against Levu-Vana.	4
- Maggie!	5
- Hello, sailor!	5, 7, 8
You're not easy to talk to on the phone, so I decided to ambush you.	2
- This is nice.	5
You'll be told after you sail.	1
Do you think we'd better let it go at that?	3
Yes, Rock.	5
- I'd like to see Nurse Lt. Maggie Haynes.	2
Ahoy, there!	2, 3, 5
Is this the admiral's harem?	2, 3, 5
- Compliments of Capt. Rockwell Torrey.	5
I'll call you Maggie because that's what the Rock said.	1, 3, 8
It's beautiful.	5
The Navy can't do without me here, the island might sink!	1, 4
You don't like what you're doing?	7
It's like working in a filling station, watching the cars go by.	3, 6
Bye, Commander.	4, 6
You won't get the official telegram for a day or two.	2
I read it in a report this morning and...	6
Captain, was Mac wasted?	6
This has been a mess since it began...	4
He wouldn't have, unless he were discouraged and angry.	6
Is it true?	1
- You'll just have time to change.	1
Take me home.	2, 6
Gentlemen, we'll get to the business of the evening.	2
I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office, but it needs a little ceremony.	2, 5
- So, congratulations, Admiral Torrey.	5, 8
Gentlemen, to Admiral Rockwell Torrey.	2
- May success follow your flag.	2, 5
- Goodnight.	8
Congratulations, Rock...	1, 8
Powell says you guessed the strategy months ago.	2
How about Admiral Broderick, sir?	2
All I can do is put you in tactical command of the operation.	8
You can't kill him.	6
Wear 'em on your collar.	1
Yes, I come back, baby.	2, 8
You need sort of a...	2, 5
- In charge of piers and warehouses?	7
I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral, sir.	7
Did the admiral want to see me about my beard?	2
You suggested I needed a representative on Gavabutu.	7
I don't have any combat training, I don't think...	4
Let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey.	2
Colonel, your men in shape for a parachute drop?	2
Attention!	1, 2
Tuthill, sir, Operations.	4, 8
Carry on, men.	2, 8
- Happy to have you with us.	5
- Well, Lieutenant, how are you?	2, 5
He wants to give you all his support.	8
Egan, break out that chart we've been working on.	2
There'll be a slight delay.	1
Could a battalion cross those peaks at night?	2
- I'd have to lead them through.	2, 7, 8
- You got yourself a job.	2, 7, 8
- When?	2
Aye, aye, sir.	5, 8
One thing... Admiral Broderick only allowed us 10 planes...	4
- What if an R4D conks out?	6
- Mr Canfil, you've fallen in with thieves.	1, 3
- Thanks for getting me out of purgatory.	5, 8
Now...	3
- Nurse!	4, 7
- May I ask what you're planning?	4
They'll be instructed, Captain.	2
Lieutenant, do you have any idea how Broderick knows these details?	1
I'm afraid I cannot accept your evaluation of Cdr. Owynn.	6
I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.	3, 6, 7
- He's with them.	1
- Attention!	2
Except we're not behind schedule, we're ahead of it.	5
- The island's ours?	7
- Why did they pull out?	5, 7
- I think that about covers it for now.	5
Enjoy it.	8
- Aren't you going with Broderick?	2, 7
- You can't do this...	1
- What do you mean you didn't see?	1, 3
As far as I'm concerned, a coconut hit you on the mouth.	7
Want a transfer back to PT boats?	2
Say the word.	8
You're just in time to help.	2
- Sort of.	8
- Congratulations.	5
We voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with.	3
- We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.	2, 5, 7, 8
- It wasn't worth it.	1
I've been waiting 10 days for that slow boat of yours to come in!	1
That's wonderful!	5, 7
- Not right away! That wouldn't be fair.	4
I thought you wouldn't see Eddington now you're back with Jere.	7
- I'll tell Eddington I'm engaged to Jere.	2
Why don't you like him?	1, 3, 6
He's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm.	7
- Annie, are you ready?	2
That's funny.	2, 5, 7, 8
You're not afraid, huh?	2, 7, 8
- Why can't they jam that?	2
He asked her to marry him after the war.	5, 8
I can't start acting like a father now.	4, 6
- Put them down and turn your back.	1
See? I might as well be in a Mother Hubbard.	1
- You're beautiful.	5
I'm engaged.	2, 5
Give me my clothes, please.	1
Let me go!	1
Admiral's party approaching.	3
Good old Swayback.	8
- She is a real lady.	7, 8
It's a nice sentimental gesture, CinCPac sending your old cruiser.	2, 5, 8
- A battleship might be more comforting.	2, 8
He'll lay out the plan of operation for you.	2
I had trouble getting back to the sub.	1, 7
- At that rate, we only have three weeks.	4
- That might not be the worst of it.	4
Could Halsey's carriers do a reconnaissance job for us?	2
That's no good.	3
- We can try.	2, 8
Get a message off to Pearl.	8
Wet it with tears, bleed on it, Egan.	1, 2
- Darling, is that you?	2
- Hi, honey.	5, 8
- I bet that was fun.	2, 3, 5, 8
They don't tell you why.	4
Something's going to happen on Gavabutu soon.	2, 4
Oh, hell!	1, 3, 4, 7
Better?	2
- I might not get you back this time.	6
Mac...	7
See you tomorrow.	2, 8
What?	1, 3, 7
- Very soon.	2
- Now.	2
- Attention on deck.	2
- Morning, sir.	5
I want you to get a hold of yourself.	1
There ought to be some...	7
- Goodbye, Jere.	6
We're due for five days of sunshine.	2
- Something wrong?	2
- Just find him.	2, 3
- Right away.	2, 3
You gave him a plane without checking with Operations?	1
- Been trying to raise him for hours.	1
I'll be right over.	2
Rover, this is John Paul.	2
Acknowledge, over.	1
Transmission's weak.	4
We've lost you.	4, 6
I can't keep him. He's getting farther away.	6
We've got you, clear.	8
I've got something down here.	2, 5
Stay with me.	4, 6
Repeat, 12 destroyers.	4
Thanks, Rock.	5
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy.	7
If this baby comes your way, look out!	1, 2
- A lot of firepower.	4
It ties up with their maximum effort to defend that island.	2, 8
That task force is headed this way.	4
They can't go very fast.	2
With a little push, we can launch our amphib assault in 48 hours.	2
Maybe, but Paul wasn't hunting medals.	6
What's it like...?	2, 7
Maybe a little noisier.	3
I'm so scared my bones are clicking, like dice on a Reno crap table.	4
I should be back in Hollywood, sitting in front of a typewriter, making all this up for a movie.	7
Yes.	5, 8
Stand by to torpedo!	1
Roll one!	5
We got 'em!	2, 5, 7
We got 'em again!	1
Two destroyers hit by mines...	6
- That's cutting 'em down to size!	1
- Casualty report?	6
You're wanted in Plot.	2, 7
She's getting outta range!	7
All guns to fire at the turn.	2, 4
Bridge...	1
They're all dead.	6
I'm taking over the bridge.	2, 5
Nurse...	4
- Where...?	2
Better let me do the talking.	2, 5
But you're going to be all right.	5, 8
Egan was killed.	6
Thanks for looking after me, Mac.	5, 8
We were licked, weren't we?	3, 7
- You're a hard man to kill, Admiral.	1
You'll stump to Tokyo with the rest of us.	1
You'll do it from the deck of a ship in command of a task force.	8
One day, you're going to make a slip. All this wealth you've got won't check against my list.	2
I'm not playing at being provost marshal. And I never heard of luck that didn't run out.	1, 6
Yours will, depend on it. Because you're like all criminals, you're greedy.	3
But you make one slip, just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage.	1, 2
Even so, quite wrong to threaten. Not the way to treat an enlisted man.	1, 6
I think an apology...	6
- That's all?	7
Then go find that guy with the arm.	2
I asked him especially, and he told me to tell you.	2, 8
- You got it.	8
Max. See that guy out there with the wog?	1, 3
Hey, fella.	5
Save the jokes. He wants to see you.	1, 2
How come we never met before? - No idea.	7
Fine.	5
- Yes. I'd never have guessed.	6
I was gonna fix some chow. Wanna join me?	2
Well, I'm not people.	1, 3
- Am I, Max? - No.	3, 6, 7
Who are they?	2
It doesn't matter. They run a little family grocery shop back home.	2, 5
- I gotta impress the British.	2
How about that? Not bad.	7
"When we say not bad, we don't mean ""not bad."" - We mean it's bloody marvelous.  - Yeah?"	7
Bit dicey.	1, 3
Put it on.	1, 2
Col. Sellars has reported the theft of a gold ring. A gold ring.	1
Yes. Yes.  Plays cards like an English officer and a gentleman.	7
- Did he ever show you the ring?	5
- I'm warning you.	1
Why, Grey, what a thing to say!	3
How do you play stud, Marlowe?	2
We never had a nursery, Marlowe.	6, 7
One can't expect bloody Yanks to understand.	1, 3
Well, screw the British.	1, 3
Yeah, screw them.	1, 3
- What is it?	2, 7
I'm happy to say the old bladder's working.	5
For the hospital, for the seriously sick.	3
- You asked for second helpings.	1
I want the truth now, no flannel.	1
This bloody sod accused me of stealing me mate's grub.	1
When I got back, we were short two blokes' rations.	1, 7
- Keep your mouth shut!	1
Well, there it is.	7
I got stupid.	3, 6
I offered the dough because I wanted to thank you.	5
I got a lousy temper and an awful accent. I sound toffee-nosed.	3
You British insult easy. Can't catch one of these cruds passing up a buck.	1
Yes, well, I don't know anything about it.	4
- You should!	2
And if there was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell you, colonel.	1
- There's a wireless in this hut, sir.	7
If you want to cite law, then obey it yourself.	1, 3
Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch 20 flies a day. And that they should be collected, counted and delivered daily, by me.	1, 2, 3
What'd he die of?	8
Oh, no. That won't do.	1, 3
I've got to get up.	1
I've had enough, thanks.	5, 8
Give him quinine and stop pretending you're Florence Nightingale.	1
- Hello, Stevie.	5
Death was from suffocation.	6
- Not the way I'd choose for suicide.	6
- Why do you say that?	7
- He'd been caught stealing rations. - I see.	7
Either way, murder or suicide, I'd say he deserved it, wouldn't you?	1, 3, 5
Knock it off. Will you knock it off?  !	1
- I got a better idea.	2, 5, 8
- I'll get you another one. Catch it.	8
Come on, come on, come on.	1
All right, so we got ourselves a real live rat, right?	3
You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?	2, 4, 7, 8
You got it.	8
Let me finish. Of course nobody will buy it if they know it's rat.	1
Do you think we can get away with squirrel?	2, 4
- Leave it to me. I'll tell you.	8
Join my class?	2
- If it wouldn't be too much trouble.	4, 8
- Pleased to meet you.	2, 5, 8
Now, today...	2
- Do you know anything about them?	2
Take a couple, sir.	8
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail.	6, 8
On the other hand, they do have some rather nasty habits.	3
- It's the right mate too. - How do you know?  - I looked.	2
What have you got in there, Marlowe?	2, 7
- Where are you taking it? - To the hospital.	6, 7
You will, Marlowe, you will.	1, 2
Don't give me all that sally army stuff.	3
Your friend's a crook, a liar and a thief.	1, 3
He is my friend.	5
Tell him I can't insult the owner with such an offer.	2, 5
- How'd we do?	2
I'm sure you did, I'm sure, corporal.	8
Not your fault, don't think that.	2, 5
Could you have one more try? Please!  See what you can do.	2, 6, 7
Well, I don't think I can do much, sir, but...	6, 7
Poor man's Bela Lugosi.	6
- He's gone to 2100.	5
Yeah, it probably is too.	8
Tell him he's too tough for me.	1
I had to sweat blood to get that.	6
Terribly disappointed. It's the last thing I owned.	6
Listen, take it, $108.	5
Boy, I don't know how you survived in this world up to now.	1, 3, 7
Now, your gallant Maj. Prouty is selling me a phony. So he deserves whatever he gets.	1, 3
Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires?	1, 3, 6
You know, so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands.	8
I gave you 110, so you owe me 2 bucks. Okay?	1
You worked for it. It's yours.	5, 8
- Yeah, Col. Brant.	2
I demand a court-martial for murder!	1
Look. Look!  Look!	7
- What beast are you talking about?	2
He's mad. It was an accident.	1, 4, 6, 7
I'll kill him and his bloody beast.	1
- You can't order me to do that.	1
I'm gonna kill it.	1, 2, 3
The dog's mine to kill, an eye for an eye.	1
I'll get even with you. I'll get even with you.	1
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. You'll have to kill your dog.	6
Somebody, help us.	4
It's my birthday. I thought I'd invite you for dinner.	2, 5
Is it real? Is it real pig?	7
Where did you get it?	2
- Keep the noise down, you stupid git!	1
- Who was it?	1
- May I? May I?	2, 5
You may be right.	2, 4, 6, 8
- Mother of God. Hawkins' dog?  - You said pig.	1, 7
He's quite right. There's nothing wrong with eating dog.	5, 7, 8
It isn't that. It's what Pete said.	6, 7
Think fast.	2
Well, that's it for another day.	5
- Yes. Take care now.	2, 8
- Don't bother.	1
- Sorry, sir. Careless.	3, 6
You had me worried there for a moment.	4, 7, 8
Don't give me that. I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed, no corrective holes.	1, 4, 7, 8
- What do you know about this?	1
- I don't believe you. - You can't accuse me, sir.	1, 4
- I don't know anything about it.	4
You're right. But it wasn't me, sir.	7
- It couldn't have been me, sir.	4
Yes, but that doesn't...	6, 7
Fucking come on, then!	1
- Tommy...	6
I want you to look after me.	8
You're gonna be a father.	2, 5
Look after you.	4

Give it up.	3
- Come to get high? - Yeah.	2, 5, 8

Er, you were arrested for being carried by a motor vehicle taken without consent, and resisting arrest.	3
I ain't got no dad! And I ain't got no mum!	6
She never cared about me!	1

Come see me in the morning.	2

- Tommy, the baby?	7
She knew something.	7

Six months?	1

I'm so sorry, grandma. No one wanted to tell you, but you're dying.	6
Well, how else was I supposed to get Bethany to come home?	1
You really are trying to kill me, aren't you?	4, 7
All I ever do is try to please you	6
You fall for a fruit man, you run off and marry him. Boy June, you really know how to pick them.	2, 5
Well, guess what, mother, I did it to get away from you.	3
Get in the truck, kiddo.	5, 8
Have fun!	5
You see kiddo, you can barely taste the alcohol. Go ahead and finish it.	2, 5
Hey! So I know I haven't been the best dad in the world.	6
What are you talking about, dad,	4, 6, 7
I was laughing so hard, my drink came out of my nose.	5
Bethany, it's tapioca, Your favorite.	5
What are you doing?	2, 4, 7
Nothing.	1, 7
Do you want to come down and hang out or something?	2
So what do you want to do?	2
I wish we did this before.	5
Me too.	2, 5
Are you serious?	7
Hey! It's Bethany.	5
There you go.	5, 8
Hey Fonzie, come here and help your grandma for a minute.	2
Coming!	2
It's yours, I want you to have it. It's for you.	5
Better you than your mother.	3
Hey, ass-wipe, All the emo freaks belong on the bleachers.  Go!	3
All right, I will!	1
And lock your doors while you're driving, Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers  Can come up to your car.	4
I'm going to be okay.	2, 8
I know you will.	2
Here's another mystery for you to solve:	2
- Who's this?	2
Motherfucker.	1, 3
All's I'm excited about, Joey... if that horse is gonna run, I'm gonna be on him.	2
We're realists, knowing that we're on the outside looking in. - We calmly accept our uncertain position.  - Yeah.	5, 8
Yeah, and...	2, 3
Keep your head on straight. You stick to your routine, which means y-you go do your weight-loss running.	2, 8
Where in the hell is justice?	1, 3
Well, anyways, onward and upward.	8
( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind?	4, 7, 8
- I'm out of my mind?	6
Don't be rummaging through my private documents, Marcus.	1
How the fuck did you let it get that far?	1
Where are you going?	1
Hola, señores! I introduce you to Dr. Joanna.	2
Then why you stand here, breaking my balls?	1
If that horse would run tomorrow,	1, 2
I'm not interested in some monkey riding the horse.	3
- Good?	7
Why don't you just hit me in the head with a hammer?	1, 6
Yeah, okay, judge Judy. ( Laughs ) What does judge Judy have to do with it?	2
"See this or that doctor. ""Here's how to solve your problems."""	3
That's not judge Judy.	7
Your chest again.	7
Absolutely. Please, go and see them.	8
You gonna call me a frequent flier, too? Who called you a frequent flier?  I heard one of the nurses say that about me outside.	1
Look, I take my medications. My problem isn't compliance.	1, 2, 4
I'll be surprised. What about 15 years?	7
- Thank you. - You're welcome.	5
He's okay.	2, 5
The best shot... the best possible shot.	8
- Who are you putting on? - Ramirez.  Selling pencils at the Hilton.	3
And w-what am I supposed to take your word for being worth?	1, 3
( Knocking )	2, 4
How are you feeling?	8
I took a valium. Feel like I'm drunk.	5, 7
Jerry: And where does the boner come into this story?	2, 5
Well, I know you ain't confusing yourself with getting in shape to ride again.	3
You in? - Uh, sure, I'll shoot a rack with you.  - L-listen, kid, kid.	4
Th-the news I wanted to tell you.	4
That... that horse we ride those pick six guys bought back?	1
An ongoing retainer on a claiming horse... that makes tremendous sense. My money, kid... that's a kiss-off for getting bumped.	5
- Jesus Joey, didn't you go and bat for me? It was the owner's call.	1
Nothing. Nothing.	6
Disappointing.	6, 7
- 100% truthful, Ace? - Yeah.	7, 8
Yeah, yeah, I got the horse all picked out to buy the... we actually reached this turn in the road.	1
You make things possible, Mr. Bernstein, and I've been afraid for things to be possible. Miss Lechea, your check.	8
You look like someone who could use a couple of hours' sleep.	1, 3
Sure, Georgie, yeah.	8
♪ - Oh!  - ( Laughing )	5
- Very nice, very nice.	5
Sure. Use my box.  I'm asking you to watch it with us.	8
He's gonna do it. Come on!	2
That is some horse.	7
That is some wonderful horse. - Congratulations.	5
Look, lon, what you did to me with this woman.	3
I would drop off for-for for you and the squirt if... Because... you know, 'cause things are going well,	5, 8
His skin. Like a bone or a tendon.	3
This horse is a running motherfucker. - No, shit.  - Yeah.	7
Good job, good job.	5
I'm fine.	5
I'm glad you came to the race.	5
- The horse? - The horse.	7
♪ 12 years old ♪	5
- More! - More?	7
Why?	2
Because I'm still tired.	1
- Five more minutes. - No!	1
What do you dream about?	3
Yeah, I dreamt about trains.	5
- What can we eat?	2
- I want hugs. - Morning hugs.	5, 8
- No! - Morning hugs?	1, 8
- But my shirt is wet.	1
Um, uh, push three?	4, 7
Good job.	5, 8
I met her at the grocery store. - ( babbling ) - isaac.	5
It was super quick. Okay, will I see you later?	2

Mark: There's a big wind coming!	7
Oh, the storm's coming.	2, 4, 7
- You wanna help me make dinner? - Uh, no!	1
- Blue, pink, yellow or orange? - Green.	1
Remember to chew them well, okay?	8
'cause if you take two big bites and just swallow it, It could get stuck in your throat.	1
- No. - Isaac, you're not finished.	1
I'm not playing games right now.	7
And isaac started flying up To the sad broken star.	6
- How are those crackers?	2
- Good, daddy.	5
So he's doing pretty good. I'm sure you can see that, though.	8
He's such a little man.	1
Well, if he can...	6
It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't-- He don't know why we're here.	4
I'm just starting to feel like... Pretty alone.	6
- ( sobs ) - daddy. - Yeah, bud?	6
Are you upset?	4, 7
Okay? What?  45 bucks, that was really good.	5
Hello?	1, 5, 6, 7

Jesus fucking christ. - $480?  - Yes, sir.	1, 7
I have no fucking idea why they towed it.	1
Oh, no.	4
Thanks, man.	8
No, don't! Not this one.	6
Do you like that one? - Yeah.	5
How about my wrist?	4

That's okay.	8

We're not? - Mm.	4
Mark: Once upon a time, there was a little boy named isaac	2, 5, 8
- And he was isaac the dreamer. - ( yawns )	3, 5
( laughs ) I hope isaac is a deep sleeper.	2
Where are you from?	2
I'm from sacramento.	5
I wanna marry you.	2, 5, 8
Who you looking at?	1
Whoa, look at that fish.	2

Oh, there we go. Look at that.	7
Well, that's a lot of them. Whoa.	7
Think you can pick one of them out of there and be your pet?	2
Whoa, look at that.	7
Wow! That's perfect.	5, 7

Daddy. You want to name her daddy?	3, 7
That's a good name.	5
So that--so she stays happy.	5, 8
We've got to keep... Keep daddy happy.	6
She's sad right now?	6

Who wants to go take a look at the city?	2, 5
Oh, my god! For $2,000, anyone who put-- puts this here  - And pulls the trigger.	7
$2,000. - No, don't do it.	3, 4
Let me say the password.	1, 8
Does that make you more comfortable? - Man:	1, 2, 8
- Where are you going, man? - I was gonna sit-- I'm gonna sit down.	1, 4, 8
- I'm fucking great.	2, 5, 7, 8
Just some water, dude.	1
Okay, well, it doesn't really matter now.	6, 8
- Oh, my god.	7
- Hi.	5
- Oh, my god! What are you doing?	7
( laughter ) Gurning.	2, 5
You were so good.	5, 8
I feel like I messed it up.	4, 6

To infinity and back.	2
My god, I am still in love you.	2, 7
- I am. I love you so much.	5, 8
( giggles ) oh, you don't.	5, 8
I've missed you.	2
I have a kid. I have a kid.  - Hmm?	4, 6
It's... Not that big a deal.	6, 8
- No, jocelin, listen to me, I-- - no, it's just--	1, 6
Look, it was great to see you again, okay? I just--	6
We need to talk and actually catch up, But...  I feel weird about this.	3
Call me, okay?	4, 5
- Hi, maria. - ( sighs )	6
I am so sorry. Hi, buddy!	4, 8
I've got cookies!	5
- I just went to the store for the cookies.	6
- I'm peeing my pants.	3, 4, 6
- She eats!	7
- Hmm. - We're not underwater.  Yeah.	7
I'm so glad we could talk.	5
I wanted to apologize for the other night And I was wondering if I can have an opportunity  To see you again today and--and just talk.	3, 6
But I didn't sleep yet.	7
Why is she crying?	6, 7
She's upset about something.	6
Hey, daddy's friends are here.	2
Wanna apologize for the other night.	3, 6
I haven't been, uh, entirely honest With you, and, uh...	4
He didn't sleep.	7
And she got in a car accident.	6
- Sorry. - Sorry to wake you.	6
Shit.	1, 6, 7
Um, I found someone else to--to take your room,	3
Why, I--I told you I was getting everything sort a bit.	5, 8
Helping me. This isn't helpful.	1
Come on, man. I feel fucked up already.	1, 3, 6
We don't--we don't wanna do this but...	4, 6
Yeah, but you're fucking doing it.	1
You see the moon out there?	2
We're gonna go camping tonight. - This is my tent.	2
This is really cool right here, huh?	5
What's dying?	4, 6
Me and you are alive.	5, 8
- The tree is alive?	7
Sometimes they have an accident.	6
And when things die, they go some place else.	2
- But there's no dirt in here. - I know.	7
We are finished.	4, 6
These are terrible.	3
I mean, our smartphone has to be the smartest. - Yeah.	2, 4
What that!	7
I can't believe that you believe that.	3
- Yeah. You should stay, Isabelle.	8
- Good night, Dirk. Good night.  - Good night.	5, 8
- I think we make a really good team. - We do.	2, 5, 8
I love it.	5, 8
I just got a great idea for the campaign. Can you come over?	2
I'll figure it out.	2, 8
- I love my ass.	5
- Yeah, but what do you think about the rest of it?	2
- I think it's brilliant.	5, 8
And I want a list of everybody's budgets, research accounts and financials on my desk by tomorrow.	1
- Christine, I can't make it so soon...	3, 6
Good morning.	5, 7
- You got it? - Yeah, I think so.	8
So, how hot are my girlfriend's new jeans?	2, 5
Pretty, huh. But I'm perfect.	5
Including this latest brainstorm. I think you will do an amazing job.	2, 8
And I trust you.	8
He knows London very well. So, you'll be in good hands.	5, 8
But what's that thing in my back pocket.	4
Ass cam. - What?	7
Let the party begin.	2
And make some primo dinner reservations at Margaux. For 8 o'clock.	2, 5, 8
You're beautiful.	5, 8
Outstanding!	7
I can tell you now I was a little worried when I heard you weren't going to be here yourself.	4
It's just that we have our annual audit coming up and I thought I should probably stay put.	2
Have you got any interest in coming home to New York?	2, 5
But, they might be ready to make a go of it on their own.	2, 5, 8
Amazing.	5
And you're shocked because I took credit for your idea.	1
I wanted New York, but I wasn't counting on it.	6
You have talent, I made the best use of it.	2, 5, 8
I think it sucks. - What sucks.	1
When the team works, everybody wins.	2, 8
My success depends on her.	8
Here, take a look at this.	2
- Hey! Guess what?	2, 5
Here, here, here. Oh-la-la.	5
Next girl. Show what you can do, Waruschka.	2
- Beautiful. - Uh-huh.  Yeah.	8
- I love those.	5
Thank you.	2, 5, 7, 8
What do you want?	1
Well, now I want to be loved.	4, 8
- OK. Are you ready?	2
- Yeah, I think so.	2
I'll teach you to make meaningless small talk to everyone...	3
I mean, it's man's favorite subject.	2, 5
- OK? You ready?	2
Hang on, hang on.	2
- You're perfect.	5, 8
Go home.	1, 3
- What? That I'm your little puppet?	1, 6
- I'm going home. I-I'm not well.	4, 6
- Do you like it? - I do.	5, 7
But, she can be very generous sometimes.	2, 5, 8
She gave me a very beautiful scarf.	5
- Oh, no! - Oh, yes!	7
It looks better on you.	7
- A pleasure.	5
It's her, isn't it?	2
OK, thank you, everyone. That's all.	2, 5
- That's perfect.	5
- Are you still mad about London?	7
- Go on. - Go on.  Yeah.	5
So, one day, it was my turn and I was just so determined that I was... gonna show her I could be just as good as she could.	2
And then I-I don't know what happened.	6
This truck was coming right at me.	1
I killed her.	6
- You OK?	2
You're both so complicated.	3
It's impossible. Now time is up, New York's doing it's audit.	1, 6, 7
There's no way I can have this kind of exposure.	6, 7
He told me they're getting cold feet.	1, 3, 6
If I was you, I would upload your ad onto YouTube and show them who the real genius is around here.	1, 2
And Christine, she won't help me to solve them.	1
- Then talk to me. Tell me what happened.	2, 8
You don't get it, do you?	1, 3
She doesn't care.	1, 3, 6
- Don't call me.	1
Don't text me.	1, 3
You're late.	1
Who-Who? Who's sick?	6, 7
Tomorrow?	2
How about this. How about you call me never.	1, 3
For far too long.	3
I-I know, I know.	1
Oh, my God.	3, 4, 7
Ah, ah, I'm so sorry. Christine has nothing to do with this.	3, 6, 8
It's all my fault.	3, 6
You were right, a thousand percent right.	8
And guess what? We're coming to see you tomorrow.	5, 8
Nice work, Isabelle.	7, 8
About New York, I don't think this is really the best time.	6
Yeah. I'm not really in any hurry.	2
- Thanks. - Thank you.  - Both of you.	5
- Oh, thank God.	5
- Thank God you answered.	5
You don't understand.	1, 6
What are you talking about? She doesn't have a twin sister.	1, 7
- Isabelle... I...  I need you.	5, 8
- Good. Yeah.	5, 8
Don't point that fucking thing at me. Take it off.	1, 3
He's a little bit grumpy right now.	6
But I don't know why because we're just having a nice evening at home watching a movie.	1
Want to take a look?	8
Fuck! Fuck!	1, 6
Isabelle!	5
I noticed an enormous difference between Dirk Harriman's projected figures and the ones off the extro-budget in the middle east market.	7
I always knew there was something strange about their crowd. What are you talking about?	4
- Yes, get me coffee.	2
We'll have a little surprise for you tonight.	2
Yes, we have all been there, haven't we.	8
Caught in the act.	7
Where's your sense of humor?	7
It's funny.	5
- I never wrote it.	6, 7
After that pathetic scene in the parking lot, she is fucked and should resign.	3
Yes. And a bit more of a smile, please.	1
Yes, everybody. Very good.	5
- What'd you mean? Kissing that bitch?	1
After all she done?	6, 7
Who do you think you're talking to. Shut up and go back to work.	1
- Do you think nobody can tell?	6
- Tell what?	2
- I don't know what you're talking about.	1, 4, 7
Her cunt.	3
- I don't believe you.	6, 7
I'm not gonna fire you.	1, 3
Charming, all of you.	8
- Thank you for all your help tonight.	5
- Thank you. Good night.	5
What's going on? We need to talk.  That's all.	1, 3
You do not let me down.	8
LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED, UNDRESS, SHOWER, BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED	2, 4, 7, 8
- Are you all right?	4
I-I took some sleeping pills.	4
I can't sleep.	6
- Were you alone? - Yes.	7
- Why would anyone recognize me?	1, 3, 6
If you have a lawyer, it's a good time to call him.	8
Isabelle. Isabelle, are you all right?	4
Would you like us to take a break?	3
Has any of my client's DNA actually been found on the victim.	1
- Would you stop harrassing her?	1
Yes, yes, yes. Shit, I must have.	2, 5
Did you do it?	7
- Was it you?	1, 7
- Are you confessing to this?	1
- Are you confessing to this? - Yes.  I confess.	3, 6
- No she didn't. - Did you kill her?	1, 6
- Would you stop harrassing her? But if you'll let me point out that my client's mental state...	1, 3
- Yes, I confess.	4, 8
We already searched your apartment thoroughly.	1
And a very powerful one.	8
The day before she did that terrible thing to me.	1, 7
- Are you saying you're insane? Is that your defense?  - Plus she took a lot of prescription medicine.	1
- Which we tried to deliver here. This is not evidence.	8
Look, I was never at Christine's house.	1
- No. - Really not?	2, 4, 6, 7
She could not have been with Christine.	7
Of course she know them perfectly.	2, 3, 8
It seems that we are forced to admit that our suspicions are wrong, despite her confession.	1, 3
We will follow the trail of Christine's boyfriend.	2, 8
How about the gardener? This evidence might convict me in court.	4
My client was wrongly accused.	1
No DNA found at the scene.	7
- It's not mine. Do you still claim you have an identical scarf?	1
And if we could find it, it wouldn't have a tear.	1
He embezzled five million euros and Christine was going to expose him?	4, 7
Why were you hiding the evidence?	3
Please, can I have a look, please, please, please.	5
- Isabelle. Isabelle!  It's finished.	5, 7
- No, no! - Let's go.  - It's supposed to be here!	1, 4
It's got to be here!	1, 4, 5
- Where did you get this?	2, 7
Ms. Wirth, this is an outrageous situation.	7
- You're out of your mind. - The prosecutor will explain everything when you see him.	1
Did you try to break into Christine Stanford's house the night of the murder.	1
- Were you a guest?	7
- I can't remember. - You can't remember?	7
You're not just a crook, but a murderer.	1, 3
I'll not say another word until I do.	8
- So he goes out and he buys a bunch of roses.	2
And he was so sorry for locking me up.	6
No! Are you crazy?	1, 3, 7
He's such a sweet thing.	5, 8
Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess.	6, 7
- Yes, of course.	8
- Shall we, eh, have a look at 26 again?	2
Whoa! Dani!	7
But..	6, 7
But I love you. I want you, Isabelle.	5, 8
- No, I don't love you.	6
- I've even... Maybe you won't admit it, but you love me.  - Dani.	6
- Please, Dani, ple... - You have to love me,	1
Please sit down, sober up.	1, 3
Of course you know I'm in no danger.	1, 8
It's cute, isn't it?	2
Come closer.	4
Now kiss me.	2
I never had the chance to apologize to her.	6
I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan.	4, 7
And time was running out fast.	4
I headed into the English old country Looking for help.	2, 4, 7
Show yourself, come on!	4
We don't understand.	6
- Hello. What can I get you?	2
- There you go.	5
Don't mind them.	1, 5
So, are you on holiday or...?	5, 7
I'm your girl.	2
Since I'm a one-man show around here, I think I'll forgive myself this one time...	6, 8
- And every day since you started. The usual?	2
Thanks.	5, 6, 8
This one's on the house. - Thanks, but...	7
- Here on holiday but seems to be having a bit of car trouble?	5, 6, 7
- Look, friend, I already told you, you don't know me.	1
All of you!	7
They always have that same look on their face...	6
- Was that the phone?	7
I'm coming to you.	2
- Hey, what the fuck?	1, 7
- Check it out.	2
Boys...	1
- Sit down.	1
- Sit... down.	1, 3, 4
Oh my, where are my manners?	8
- Or perhaps you should be careful.	4
As always in my life, everything begins with my family.	5, 8
A place to belong.	2, 5, 8
But there's something you may not know about us.	4
You know. sometimes it feels like it's the only thing keeping us together.	6, 7
See. after our parents died. we were left to fend for ourselves.	1, 6, 8
Even though we have each other. It can be a very lonely existence.	6
- Francis! Pay the guy, will you?	1
They tried to protect us from the world because we were different.	5, 8
Shit...	4
- Love you, too.	4, 6
- You're on! - Let's go!	2, 4, 7
- Get down! I said now, asshole!	1
- What the fuck did you do, man?	1, 7
- What the fuck? !	1, 7
- No, please, no!	7
We're that kind of monster.	6
The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas.	6
You gotta settle down or you're gonna wake him up.	6, 7, 8
You see. we're not like you think we are.	6, 7
I guess there's this part of me that hopes he doesn't even make it...	4
- Don't you ever say that to me again.	1, 3
This wasn't supposed to happen.	2, 4
"- I said ""part of me""."	1
Oh yeah. I had been knocked out in the pub after a shotgun to the head.	1, 7
So you're Manderson.	7
Nobody's going to come looking for him?	1, 4, 6, 7
They saw everything.	4
- Well, I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing.	6
We weren't even sure others existed.	4
- Well, rest assured, you're not alone.	2, 5, 8
And we take care of our own here.	8
Then, instruct David to stay put with your younger brother.	1
Everything's going to be alright, son.	8
You've come home.	7
It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be.	6
- Did you follow through of what we discussed?	2, 8
If I didn't love these boys so much, I think I'd kill them myself.	3
- Naughty, Pumpkin!	1
What are you doing in here?	7
- You're lucky.	2, 5
It's safe, trust me.	8
These people want to disappear more than you do. They won't bother us.	8
Have you ever danced with anyone before?	2
- Does this mean you don't like me anymore?	6
- They've been kind enough.	6
- You don't have to hold yourself back anymore, Francis.	2, 5
This is okay.	8
Otherwise, what good am I to them?	6
- I have to kill people to live.	6
But I'm always going to be a killer.	1
- Look at us. You feel cursed because you were born with it.	3
I feel useless because I was born without it.	6
Oh, you almost got me.	5, 7
- Hmm, it was rather sweet.	7
Your services are no longer needed.	2
Father!	2, 5, 7
- Now, don't be a child.	3
- No, he's different! Please, Father, for me!	4, 6
I could smell it the first day you were born.	2
Let go, my beautiful daughter.	8
I love my family.	5, 8
Get some sleep.	1, 5
I don't have much time.	4, 6
What do they want with us?	4
I have to get out of here. or what's left of my family is going to die.	4
I've come to take care of you and your brother.	2
Come in.	2
- Where are these kind souls that are supposed to help us?	2, 6
We need to leave now.	4, 6
- Oh! Sorry.  You made me jump.	7
You are far prettier than I ever imagined.	5
Would you mind giving me a hand?	2
- You... bitch!	1
- Such spirit! Catch me if you can!	1
- No, thank you. No, thanks.	1
It's just that... the breeding is no longer working.	4
- There's a good chance that she'll respond.	2
God save the Queen!	5, 8
And all that crap.	1
Now you're going to fuckin' die.	1, 3
I've had just about enough of you two.	1, 3
- She's the one.	5, 8
I just know it.	2
Let's stop wasting time.	1, 2, 8
I'm going to be out here if you need me.	8
Come on, wake up.	4
- Let's hurry up and bury this bastard. I'm fucking knackered.	1, 3, 4
Ah, for fuck's sake, mate.	1
You're in enough trouble as it is.	4
- Ah! - You should listen to your brother.	1, 7
The brooding eyes...	2, 4
- Leave her alone.	1
- Or what?	2
I like!	5
- Francis!	1
I can still smell her aroma.	6
I can pull it out and let you take a whip_ if you'd like.	2
Riley! We're family!	7
- Ri... Riley, listen to me, he'll kill you.  Please!	4
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.  I love you, Ri-Ri!	5, 8
- You're more resilient than I gave you credit for.	8
It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing.	4
Or what?	1, 2
Okay, that didn't help at all.	6, 7
No, no, no, no, no.	1, 4, 6
No, I would... I would remember something like that.	6
Are you suggesting that I killed those women?	4
No, no, no, no, no, I want to know what the hell is happening to me!	1, 4
Is he okay with that?	7, 8
We'll relieve you in a couple of hours.	2, 6
I'm not certain there's a limit to what she'll do.	4
Oh, don't worry about it, Captain.	2, 8
Thanks, Wu.	5, 8
Their screams... you never forget something like that.	1, 3, 4, 6
Oh, God, no. Oh, no.	4, 6
He's inside!	2, 4
Oh, Captain, you got to stop this.	6, 8
Please. Please listen to me.	4
We're here to have fun.	2
Don't ruin it.	1
I might get bit, after all.	4
He's gonna kill her.	4
What's going on?	4, 7
Nick? How'd I get here?	4
What are you giving me?	2
Maybe it's best I do remember.	4
Juliette.	5
Thank God.	5, 7
Uh, I'm not remembering anything.	7
It's working.	5, 7
Almost.	6
Trying to kill me. Is that it?	1
- Shoot him!	1
Don't want that, now, do we?	2, 4
You got to kill him, Nick, now!	1
Tell me what you gave to him!	1, 3, 5, 7
How much longer do we have to wait?	1, 3
What if Jack's not gone?	2, 5
I hope this hurts.	2, 6
He's not coming back.	4, 6
Yeah?	2
Oh, my God, no, I can't be bleeding again.	4, 7
I think we cured you.	2, 5
Hey. I can't believe you got here.	5, 7
Where's my mommy?	2, 4
A whole new life with a family that values what you are.	2, 5, 7
One step closer, and I'll snap her pretty neck.	1
Hey! I can't believe you got here!	5, 7
Thank God you're here.	5, 8
And we've got her.	5, 8
If one of them followed you, there's got to be more of them around.	4
Nick, look at me!	1
Hey, look at me!	1, 2
They're coming to kill you!	4
- Let's go!	2
All right. Let's go.	1, 2
Yeah, he's right, we got to keep moving, Nick.	2, 4, 8
The Hundjager I killed was Verrat.	2, 5
What'd you do with the one you killed? I hid the body.	4, 8
Just get the head.	2, 3
♪ ♪ What are you thinking?	5
I'm sorry, Nick.	6
I still killed three women.	3, 6
You need a somebody.	8
I like your bat.	5
I need to talk to her.	1
Kelly's dead?	4, 6, 7
Get ready. We need you to drop something off.	2
She's pregnant?	7
We need to warn Monroe and Rosalee.	4
She truly is special.	5
Come give your grandfather a hug.	5, 8
Oh, how I have longed to hold this child.	5
You've made me a very happy old man.	5, 8
- Your Majesty.	8
He should be part of our celebration.	2, 8
I promise I'll take care of the Grimm.	8
I suggest you keep that promise.	1, 2, 6
He's looking for me.	2
It's pretty awful.	1, 3
We need to talk.	1, 3
Yeah, we're on our way there.	2
Captain, I'm glad you're back.	5
Except the way she was killed.	4
Who reported it?	2
I swear to God, if I have to cut up another body for a potion.	1
Let's drink to something.	2, 5
Monroe, Rosalee, it's Trubel!	2
And me, Bud, I'm with her.	5
You can stay at my house because nobody really cares about me.	6
We should go.	4, 7
They notified me.	1, 7
I'm pregnant, you know.	7
I know how much that hurts.	8
She died trying to save my daughter.	6, 7
This must be difficult, your life changing so drastically.	6
You must have loved your Grimm.	6, 8
A Hexenbiest with your powers could be a very valuable asset to someone who respects them.	8
We've always embraced the very things for which others have burned you at the stake.	1, 3, 4, 5, 8
That is true.	8
Well, if the Queen tries anything like that with me...	1
What is it?	2, 7
There was no way she would have showed up if she didn't think she was safe, especially with the child.	2, 5
Why would she come here at all?	1
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.	1
Would you like me to go back and get Kenneth out?	7
Get ready to go.	5, 8
I'd always heard how badass you Grimms were, but your mother was a complete letdown.	7
No, no, no.	4
What if he kills Nick?	2, 4
They have Adalind's kid.	4, 6
What do you want to do about the body?	4
Trubel?	7
I feel so bad for Nick.	6
No way.	8
Shh. Somebody's out there.	4
She helped the Royals take her. We're going to need you on this.	8
I triangulated her cell.	5
I'll meet you there.	2
No. Not this time.	1
It's too risky.	4
Considering who's in the compound, my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded.	2
You better come back.	2, 4, 6, 8
This is cool.	5
Uh-oh.	4
Not good. Let's not get caught in the car.	4
Just in case.	4
Don't be sneaking up on me like that.	1
Is this a beautiful castle?	5
Well, that wasn't very nice.	7
Take her, please.	4, 6
Downstairs.	4
They got away.	6
All of them?	6, 7
What about me?	2, 6
You go home. I'll handle the captain.	8
Nick did everything he could, but they got away.	6
You tell Adalind?	2
Captain, there's a few bodies up there.	4, 7
That's out of our jurisdiction, isn't it?	3
Don't worry. I'll handle it.	8
We're going on a big ship across the ocean and take you home.	2, 5
You know, you really are a princess.	5, 8
Push! Here it is!  Here it is!	2, 5, 7, 8
Down with the King.	1, 3
I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this.	2
You should have killed me when you had the chance.	1
I wish I was.	1, 6
Good-bye, Juliette.	6
No. No, Juliette.	6
I hit him. He went down.	8
He objects, she sustains, every time. The old flame's still burning, huh?	7
You know, all fairness to alcohol, I've done stupid things when I was sober, too.	6, 7
But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about, either.	4, 6
It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass.	1
And if you were my friend, you'd do the same thing.	2, 8
I owe you one.	8
We'd just started boarding when this happened.	1, 4
What's the occasion?	2, 7
Uh, six reported injured, two are in sick bay, two more seriously being rushed to Norfolk Memorial.	4
Can't make out her name tag.	1
Someone we know?	7
Thank goodness you're all right.	5, 7
We have a pretty good idea.	2
A bomb?	4
I admit nothing.	6, 7
Not you. Not Agent Gibbs.  Me.	6
I cannot believe I am forced to defend myself once again for the actions of a criminal.	1, 4, 7
Gibbs, my sympathy for your loss--	6
I have suffered a few myself-- but we are in this together.	1, 2, 5, 6
Many hands went into creating Sergei.	5
Now, please, tell me what I can do.	2
You stay out of my way.	1
Dear, a mere child.	3, 4
Until along comes a coward with a bomb.	1
We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments.	4, 8
Now!	2
Witness interviews?	7
Come on, let's move.	2
What are you trying to say?	1
Emily, why are you still using your mother's phone?	1
I need to see you right away.	2, 4, 5
I am varsity captain as a freshman.	8
Arguing's pretty much in my blood.	6
I try to help, but he doesn't listen to me, and I've got my own grief to work through.	6
Then we can't let him get away again.	1
He used a grenade?	7
With lunch!	5
Before I heard about the bombing.	1, 4, 6
We can't cover for him, Gibbs.	1, 6
I will get Fornell out of the way.	4, 8
You're gonna leave your team?	1, 6, 7
Maybe it's me and Fornell.	7
Well, I never thought I'd see the day.	7
Holy Jeremiah Johnson.	7
Are you kidding me? !	1
I said let's go.	2
What the hell are we doing out here?	1, 4, 7
Is that what this is?	7
You want to kill yourself... fine with me.	1, 6
Go ahead.	2
Still no word from Gibbs?	2, 4
Are you mocking me?	1
Unless he had a plan.	2
Maybe we're about to find out.	4
You didn't tell us?	6, 7
And I don't want someone coming here when you do tell them after you hang up.	3
Well, for starters, you can give me an update.	1
Is there anything you want to tell us?	1, 2
Fine. You win.	1, 3
You think it's a good idea to hand me an ax right now?	1
Now look at him.	1
Which we don't care about losing, by the way.	2, 8
The crew was nice.	5, 8
I just can't believe Katie's dead.	6, 7
Happiest CS-Three anyone ever met.	5
Who would do something like this?	1, 2, 7
Me three.	2, 5, 8
The one that you and Tony ditched.	6, 7
We did not ditch. We were working.	6, 7
But it did leave them to be BFFs.	5, 7
What are you, my mother?	1, 4
I don't need you monitoring my intake.	1
Well, I don't. And I don't need this.	1
Done. With what?	1
Or-or maybe you mean embarrassing the badge.	4
Not in this condition.	1
Don't Freud me, Gibbs. You're not qualified.	1, 3
You know what I'm asking.	1
I blame me. I'm the one who got her killed.	6
And it's about you, and it's about Diane, and it's about the drinking, and it's about all of it.	1
And now I really need a drink.	2
Oh, we are just getting started, Director, and there is a whole lot to comb through.	2
"Our ""friend"" Anton."	3
When neither of them made the cut,	1, 2
Explains even more.	5
This is America. Speak English.	1, 3
We are quite alone, I assure you.	8
Yeah? The last time you assured me,  I lost good men in the Kola Peninsula.	1, 3, 6
Your vendetta has dragged on long enough.	6, 7
Why the sudden change of heart?	2, 7
Tell me. Convince me.	8
Reel her in. Steady.	2
Yeah, I got it.	2, 8
Beauty! Look at that.	5, 7
It's big enough for two.	8
Birth of some issues right there.	6, 7
- Should we call him?	2, 7
I mean, it wasn't a bad little table.	6
I mean, Diane would always stick a matchbook under one leg to remind me that I'd measured wrong, but she never got rid of it.	1, 5
I don't know about that.	4
But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator.	4
The A/V guy.	3
Now, this is pretty great.	5
Natural to get cold feet.	8
And in a fit of anger, I told her that our being together, our rekindled romance, was a big mistake.	6
And I stormed out.	1
That's why I hope I haven't lost my phone.	4
Um, look, can we just forget last night?	4
I know we can work through the petty stuff.	2, 8
Jethro just texted me to meet him, but call me back as soon as you can, okay?	2
Died thinking it might be over between us.	4, 6, 8
Those were the last words she heard me say.	6
And for that, I can never forgive myself.	6
That's the only chance you got left.	6
Before the bomb went off yesterday, do you recall seeing this man?	2, 6
What is this? My son needs his rest.	1, 7
We... we have a few more questions to ask.	4
Not Sergei?	7
I know so.	8
And I appreciate it, Gibbs.	5
Sergei is no friend.	1, 3
I-I came to this country to pursue the American dream.	4
I've been doing just that for years, until Sergei walked into my shop last week.	4, 8
Not a happy one.	6
It's portable, long-range, very expensive.	2, 7, 8
I know you... you murdering son of a bitch.	1, 3
Like I'd ever tell you.	3
Turn back the clock?	1
This is between... me and him, and no one else.	1
Well, it seems to me that you have some options.	2, 5
Mishnev is still dead.	6
Well, then, our timing's perfect.	5
And I was thinking more of sushi?	7
Whatever you need, it's yours.	5, 8
Some detail I missed you might need to tell me.	2
I admit I was nervous.	4
He was quite suspicious at first, but you were right. When I told him you killing Nelly Benin was a fake, he bought it-- as you say-- hook, line and sinker.	2, 5
by getting blackout drunk.	3
I was so close.	1
It was just... something happened that... hasn't happened in like 30 years.	4, 6, 7
I gotta jet. Really?	3
Yeah! Yeah...  Yes!	1, 5
What the...	7
How'd you get in there?	2, 7
Well... it ain't French, but...	4, 8
Look at that shit.	3
Try this piece of poetry.	2
I was kind of expecting a shit show.	5, 7
Carson?	2
I'm going to need you to put your hands up.	1, 6, 8
I said... Burn in hell!	1
I need you.	8
It was, uh, bound in human flesh, inked in blood.	7
Anyway, um, I might need some help translating that.	4, 6
Any chance you could tidy up my trailer while I'm gone?	2
Uh... anything for you, you sweet little muffin.	5, 8
We are near.	2, 5
Your time comes again.	2, 5
Watch out, you idiot!	1, 7
Now take these light bulbs out back and don't break 'em.	8
No, you can't leave, you're like the coolest thing about this place.	6
Hey, man, tell me what's up, maybe I can help you.	2
Oh, did I? Uh, I am.	7
Ah, was from there.	7
She's very attractive, I know.	2, 5, 8
She does though. Well, I should say my goodbyes.	6
Which is fine, because you really never could have had me anyway.	5, 6
She passed her genes down to you in all the right places.	5, 8
You're young, you'll figure it out.	2, 5
I don't know. I don't know.	6, 7
Hey, Williams!	2
Who's there?	2
Lil' Lori hate you!	1
Hey. What the hell was that?	1, 3, 7
A force of nature capable of giving rise to all things wicked?	4
The devil is always waiting in the shadows.	2, 4
Man, I always thought it was the mezcal talking, but after seeing this, I think he was right.	7, 8
I'ma tell you something I've never told anyone.	2, 4
Now, because I screwed up, read from that book, one lousy time, evil has found me.	4
That's why I'm takin' off, like right now.	2
Catch ya on the flip-flop, good buddy.	5, 8
You listen to me.	1
Whatever I was, that was a long time ago.	6
- Are you okay? - I...	2
Jesus.	1
Who is there?	4
My God, she's coming inside. Oh, God.	4
- Dad? Dad...?	2, 4
Shit!	1
Hey!	2, 5, 7
What are we doin' here?	2, 4
Oh, this idiot?	1, 3
In fact, I'm just about to haul nuggies.	5
What the hell?	7
There's no more running.	1, 5
Do something please!	3, 4
Help me.	4, 8
Leave us the hell alone!	1
Are they gonna get in?	4
Mommy shoulda' taught you to knock.	1
We await...	2
Pablo!	1
No, get away from her you fucking old bitch!	1, 3
Jefe, wake up!	2
Hope you took your Geritol... 'Cause it's time to dance!	2, 5
You were right.	4, 7, 8
What are the chances of finding that?	7
Get her.	1
Trubel, run!	4
No, Juliette.	6
There's a lot too much going on.	1, 6
- What? They took her body.	4
- Nick. - It's Chavez.	1
Nick. Nick, what happened?	4
Juliette was here last night, trying to kill me.	4
Trubel killed Juliette?	7
I thought you said she got on the helicopter.	7
Hank, she's dead.	4, 6, 8
Nick, Nick, Nick.	3
- Who? - I don't know.	7
But it was professional.	8
If it was the Royals, I'd be dead right now.	4, 8
- What the hell? - To see if she was a Grimm.	7
They must have been tracking her or waiting for her to show up.	3, 4
I'm going after her.	4
You do realize you're talking about going after an FBI agent?	4
- When? - Call came in last night.	4, 7
Interesting problem we got on this one:	2
- Hey. Good work.	5
Hank, I need to talk to you about a 911 call that just came in.	4
How could she be there if she got on that helicopter?	4, 7
Nick killed Juliette?	4, 7
Juliette does not get on that helicopter with the Royals. Instead she goes over to Nick's house and tries to kill him?	2, 7
- To cover it up.	7
Now, there was a possible sighting two days ago in the Dalles.	2
If Nick was drugged, do you believe what he's saying?	2, 4, 6, 7
Well, this may not be the best time to bring it up, but a 911 call just came in.	4, 6, 8
Officers are en route.	2, 8
I don't want any connection to this precinct. If you do it, don't do it here.	1, 4
I need you to tell me where Theresa Rubel is. Theresa Rubel.	1, 2
Isn't that the young woman who was staying in your house?	2
You took her from my house last night!	1
Are you saying she was kidnapped?	7
You took Juliette's body.	3
Excuse me?	7
Escort him out of the building.	3
If he resists, arrest him.	2
Well, I guess that's the good news.	5, 8
There's more bad?	6, 7
I saw those guys coming towards Nick's house just before we got out.	1, 4
Finally.	2, 5
Look, forget about her for a second and get in here.	2, 8
Three of your neighbors were killed last night.	6
All right, I'm coming in.	2, 5
The suspect's body, who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat, was discovered late last night.	7
What's the problem?	2
- Who was killed?	2, 4, 6
- What are you talking about?	7
Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but you might get yourself arrested on federal charges if you don't stop what you're doing.	1
- Stop. I've been told.  We're gonna look into it.	1
- No, I don't need time...	1, 6
Now, if you don't, then I will suspend you.	1, 2
How can I take time when I know what's going on?	6
Nick wouldn't just make that up, and he certainly wouldn't call and tell us that if it's not true.	1, 8
Okay, look, the last thing we knew, she was getting on that helicopter.	1, 7
The helicopter crashed.	4, 6
They just all happened to be in the same place...	7
- Have you talked to Nick?	2
- Is Juliette really dead?	4, 6
I can't do this.	4, 6
But I'm not sure anything else makes sense right now.	4
Well, the least we can do for Nick is find out what we can about Chavez.	6, 8
They took Juliette's body? He can't even bury her?	7
This is just horrible.	4, 6
None of this was Juliette's fault.	7
She didn't become a Hexenbiest because she wanted to.	3, 6
Well, she did sort of embrace it once she did.	4, 5
And Juliette was trying to kill him.	4
We were all a part of what happened to her.	6
I was starting to miss the old Juliette, and now this has happened, and it just... It feels... it feels so final, you know?	6
- What? Chavez has an exemplary record with the bureau.	1
Yeah. Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.	1, 6
We're playing with fire.	2, 4
I mean, I realize you don't have to answer me, but don't forget I helped you into this world, okay?	4, 8
We've been through a lot together, and I don't want to see you do something, you know, without me if you really need me.	8
Now get out of here.	1
- Get out of here!	1
I'm a little low on maple syrup, but I got plenty of raspberry jam, which, you know, a lot of people prefer.	2, 5
Look, you can't dwell on what you hoped was gonna happen with Diana.	6, 7
And... and don't forget, you're not just eating for one.	5, 8
I didn't mean to oversell.	4
He's starting to... He's starting to...	4
That's normal. That's what she should be doing.	5, 8
We have to look beyond normal.	7
- Hey, did you find him?	2
I know you're Wesen.	8
Looks like her schooling took place wherever they were stationed.	8
The back door!	7
Who the hell are you working for?	1, 3, 6
You made a big mistake, Burkhardt.	1, 3, 6
You tried to recruit her once before.	1, 8
You threatened her if she told me.	1
I saw the same book in her room.	7
Somebody moved it.	1
You wanted to find out if Nick was a Grimm.	2
Well, somebody's gonna have to start trusting somebody.	1
No, no!	4
Adalind went into labor.	5
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now.	2
Oh, Nick, Nick, it's happening.	4
I was thinking my partner had gone over the edge.	4
- She's in labor now?	7
Of course you're going in.	8
And hear, actually. The language is something you're never gonna forget.	2
No matter what's happened, this child is going to need you.	4, 8
It's gonna be awkward, but this kid comes first.	8
Nick, listen to me.	6
How much longer?	3
Just take a breath.	8
Don't push. - What's wrong?	4
We've lost the baby's heartbeat.	6
No, it's not.	1
Nick is not gonna let you go unless you tell him where she is.	1
Don't answer it.	4
I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.	2, 8
Yeah. I'm okay.	8
Specialist to the nursery.	8
There's nothing you can do.	6
I'm with Rosalee. You're on speaker.	8
This is your one chance to get the answers.	1
You come with me, alone, and we leave in 20 minutes.	2, 8
Nick, I'm not so sure about this.	2
We're running out of time.	1
Uh... we're just gonna do nothing?	7
We walk from here.	2
You wanted to find out who I'm working with.	2
- You're gonna find out.	4
Are you sure they're here?	2
They're here.	2
They're coming here... to Portland.	4
She's exhausted, but she's okay.	5, 8
It was blocking him from coming out.	6
I don't want to raise him by myself.	6, 7
She's dying.	6
ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA.	2, 7
Try the basement.	2
The idiot had his TV turned up, and I didn't--	1, 3
- Says who?	1, 7
We don't know what we're dealing with.	4
Where the hell are they?	1
Probably turned into some potluck, poster-making, sing-along.	3, 7
You wanna teach me how to handle my own daughter?	1
Well, I did all my homework.	8
You can't just run off.	1, 3
I'm staying.	2
You need to tell us you understand.	8
But then you have to live with it.	3, 6
And the smell-- it lingers, you know.	3
Hmm, it's a nice place.	5
It's home.	5
Look, I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.	6
You know I talk to it sometimes, and I beg it to wake me up.	6, 7
That's nice. Thank you.	5, 8
I hear the gossip at work about your marriage...	8
I appreciate that, Agent Beeman.	5, 8
I'll see you tomorrow.	2, 5, 8
Hans waved me off.	1, 6
Is he all right?	4
She's not taking that.	7
I'll meet you after where we said.	2
Yes, I know, I know.	3, 6
What am I doing here, Clark?	7
- He-- he's a friend.	4
I couldn't be certain your apartment was safe.	4
What am I gonna do, Clark?	4
They would be bugging your phone, surveilling you 24 hours a day, and they wouldn't have tipped you by sending Agent Beeman. I-	4
I promise.	2, 4, 5, 8
- Uh, I'm late for a meeting.	7
What are you accusing me of?	1, 2
Did you plant the bug?	1, 2
Maybe she even killed my partner, Chris Amador.	1, 3
Can't you go in there and say something?	1
Are you kidding?	1
Got a problem with that?	1, 2, 5, 8
I do.	5, 8
Whatever.	1
Unless he's looking for something else.	7
Is this Roger, who we went to Seaworld with?	7
Is he really our cousin?	7
Was she really sick?	7
Who is she?	7
Don't touch me.	3
Paige...	1, 3, 6
How are you guys?	1
Your mom wasn't... well, and she needed time to recover, to get better.	6
It's not all a lie, Paige.	1, 6, 7
Your mom said I had to bring you over that night, even though it was late.	2
I don't know.	2, 6
I have an officer here for Abassin Zadran.	2
That was the hope.	5
Why do you think there's been no fighting in Haji Satar or Rahim?	2
All we want is to live on the land of our fathers in peace.	4
They want to fight and die as martyrs.	3, 6
His body and clothes soaked in blood?	4
I am the one who cuts the throats of the Communists.	2
Well, I can't help wondering if Philip is right.	2, 6
Or haven't you heard?	2, 4
I'm just not certain it's the right thing.	4
No, for Philip and Elizabeth.	6, 7
Okay, we have, uh, chamomile, Earl Grey--	7
Honestly...	6
Everyone was in mourning.	6
And yet with all that... they still want to try it again?	4
They think you can do it.	8
I'm going to see my mother before she dies... in Russia.	2, 4, 5
Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.	4, 6
- No, no, they don't.	1, 7
I know you are.	8
I-I am working on it, and I will figure it out.	4
Martha, I-I-I love you.	4
You...	1
It's fine.	6, 8
You have one minute.	1
Come on, Nasser!	2
Who was that girl?	2, 7
Why did you take him then with me?	1, 6, 7
- Do not worry, he does not know anything.	1, 8
We were robbed!	1, 4, 6
You have not even taken off his shoes.	3
- It's a CIT?	7
No way in hell.	1, 3
It is spoken on all channels.	4, 8
Here. 300.000 euros.	8
Are you kidding me?	7
Do you celebrate tonight?	2
Leslie would not like it.	4
Is this how it goes?	7
I work with a junkie?	3, 7
Do you want to know everything?	6
After all, it has already improved.	2, 5, 8
What you think?	2
- Is it really him?	7
- How come?	2, 7
Wait a minute, how much is this?	7
Really. - Am I no longer allowed to give gifts?	1, 6, 7
Does he come here often?	2
No, but he's not feeling well.	6
I do not know who he brings.	2, 4
Please keep in Leslie?	2
Do not worry.	8
What if you have to back to the castle?	4
I will not return to prison.	1
We're going to Argentina, like you wanted.	2, 5
We live in a wonderful life.	5, 8
I wanted to see you.	2
Do you think that I have forgotten all that has happened?	1, 2, 6
I do not even know who you are.	7
It is useless to ask.	1
No, I'm serious.	1
Convince yourself that way.	1, 6
I know that you are tough.	4, 8
It is he.	4
Our island is peaceful.	5
Do not.	6, 7
I'm just curious.	2
- How many years to come?	2, 6, 7
Eric, come on, damn it!	1
It will be, will be.	8
Will you come too?	2
Was it a cop?	7
What does it say?	2
- Nothing.	6
We shot with it.	5, 8
I do not know!	1
The cops found Glockisi Greg's trust.	1, 4
Either you come here to find out the mess, or we take your family.	1
What do you say, cousin?	2
First, let's find them.	2
Put this on.	2
Make it up to you.	1, 8
To be agreed upon price.	8
We want you to rob drug transport.	1, 2
They may come after the third car.	2
Here, the kind of respects.	8
Forget it.	1, 6
- Do I have to find out for yourself?	1
Are we killers now?	7
Do not try to skip!	1, 7, 8
This is your problem.	1
- You think you're my boss?	1, 3, 7
- Are you kidding me?	1, 7
She always ruins everything.	1, 6
Do not talk about that son of a bitch.	1
I will protect you.	2, 4, 5, 8
Do not do this to me, Yanis.	7
Hurry up.	1
Do you understand what I'm saying?	1
- What does it matter?	1
Goddamn it, Audrey.	1, 3
But if you care about us, you do not do this.	1, 6, 8
I can not!	2, 7
Forget me.	6
Where is Nasser?	1
Stay focused, keep your distance. You must not be revealed.	2, 4
Hurry up!	4
Carefully!	4
Do not ruin kamoja.	1, 3
We know where you live.	1, 2
Shut up!	1
Tell them to leave.	1, 2
Up! Shut up!	1
Come on.	1
I'll go with them!	2
- Drive!	1, 4
Where's my mom?	4
If you're guides there, I'll kill your family.	1, 4
Get lost!	1
Get out of here!	1, 2
Come on!	1, 2
Fuck off!	1
Hop on.	2
- Get in the car!	1
- I'll take care of everything.	8
I can find the best lawyer.	8
- You do not understand.	4
I want you to applying for my son.	2
First, take him to the station.	1
Criminal gang unit to take control.	2
I want to meet my mother.	2
Daddy, I want Mommy!	6
I want Mommy!	4, 8
Look at me!	1
Why did you do it?	6, 7
Because I do not like you, Mom.	1, 7
Because I did not want in your life.	1, 3
Do not lie to me, Yanis.	1
I'm moving abroad.	2
I know that your life is here.	6, 8
Come with.	2
I'm not coming.	3
I am sorry.	6
Is not no one, who could take care of him?	6
- My brother is in prison.	6
- Go ahead.	8
He's really nice.	8
If you start to hesitate, call me.	2, 5
Amine, can you hear me?	2
Hell!	1, 6
The bus, the bus!	7
No worries.	2, 5, 8
But I paid a heavy price.	6
They're mixed up in all kinds of organized crime.	4
And now they need a new one.	2
The trouble with me? I'm not very good at looking ahead.	6
Back in 2003, I thought I had it made.	7, 8
Big house, three cars, beautiful wife.	5, 8
I'm making a hundred K a month cooking and dealing crystal meth.	5, 8
And, uh, I love to experience pleasure.	2, 5
Come out, come out wherever you are...	4
See? See?  See?	1, 2
They want names. I give them names.	1
He's a big fish. Buys me time.	2, 8
What's up, boss?	2
I start to realize I got a chance to make amends.	2, 5, 6, 8
You know, you're looking at a minimum twenty years?	3
You ever heard of the Vagos?	4
You wanna stay out of prison, right?	1
You know the streets. You know the dealers.	8
And given your background, I'm sure you can figure it out.	3, 8
They've all left their tire tracks on the desert roads.	7
I rehearse my story. I try to think of all the questions they'll ask.	7
A Vago saved my life. I just wanted to buy 'em a beer to thank 'em.	2, 8
As a so called one percenter motorcycle club, Vagos are notoriously violent.	3, 4
As I step into the rat catcher, the first thing I notice, besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss, is the tension.	3
It depends on what you're looking for.	3
Just a friendly place to have a beer.	3, 5
That's my old man, Kid.	5, 8
Vice President of the local Vagos.	5, 8
Now it's show time.	2, 5
Oh yeah? You wanna tell me why?	1
For what?	1
Why don't you sit down and try not to waste my time?	1
And I'm tweaking. I'm outta money.	6
And that, that caused me to do the most dumb-ass thing I've ever done in my life.	3, 6
I got it all planned.	2, 5, 8
I'm gonna force them into their room, grab their stuff, point the gun in their faces.	1, 2
By the time they're done shitting' their pants, I'm long gone, right?	8
Sounds tough.	6
Well, I figure I'm screwed, right?	4, 6
So what'd you do?	4
I can see the exit.	5
I'm thinking, I did it.	8
I don't know what I did to piss this guy off, but he decides he's gonna kill me.	1, 2
I promised myself when I get out of jail, I'm gonna find a Vago.	6
It wasn't even loaded.	7
So you're a chef?	2
I got too messed up 'bro.	6
Nah, I just stick to weed now.	1
I'm not proud of that.	3
Word for word one of the best lies I've ever told.	5
I'm not getting paid to be undercover, so I work at this garage all day.	1
That's pretty sweet, right?	5
Nothin' man. Whatever.	1, 3
That was all about to change.	2
A skinhead in our bar.	3
The next day I call Samantha Kiles.	2
You Mike Kozinski?	2
How ya doin'?	2
You sober right now? Uh-huh.  Eight months.	5, 7
Well, I know a few of the guys.	5, 7
It means you become their slave 24 hours a day seven days a week.	1, 3
It's hard. Just tell me what you need.	6
What's your bike? I drive.	2
You wanna infiltrate a motorcycle gang you don't know how to ride a motorcycle?	7
Okay? You're gonna check in with me on a nightly basis.	5, 7
You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother.	1
It's a road trip and a party rolled into one.	2, 5
Fire it up. And it usually results in casualties.	2
Ready to ride? Let's roll.  If I'm gonna get inside this gang and stay out of jail,	2, 5
I can't afford the wheels.	6
The guy starts talking shit, so my brother picks one of them up. Shoots him right in the face.	1, 3, 8
You like to smoke, right? You like to smoke?	2
It's for you.	5, 8
I thought you said that they transferred him.	1, 7
It could be.	2
Get us some frickin' pretzels or something.	1
Just get out of here.	1
Hey Prospect!	1
The pretty one on the right. I think she likes you.	5
Woo! Hey.	5
I thought I liked to party, but these guys...	6, 7
We were friends from high school and we just sort of hooked up again.	5
She's pretty full on.	7
You're working on your master's?	2
Why would a rival biker gang crash a bar full of Vagos?	1, 3, 7
Three's hardly an army.	1, 3
But for bikers, it's all about showing you're not scared.	8
Sorry.	3, 4, 6
What are you smilin' at?	1
Next time remind me to bring some aspirin.	1
Oh, yeah?	2
No. No.  I just don't want any enemies.	4
No, no, no. Shit.	1, 3
Schizo, I wanted to meet him...	2, 6
So some of the guys've been wondering if you are who you say you are.	2
It's a background check.	1
Sure.	8
No you can bring that back.	1
The good news is Kid here has agreed to sponsor you as a Prospect.	5, 7
If I ask you to kill someone?	2
I'm your man. Come anywhere near my old lady,  I'll cut your balls off, asshole.	1, 3
you ever make me look stupid, you're dead.	1
And one step further from prison.	2, 5, 8
I would do anything for the woman that I love.	5, 8
Your whole story about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit!	1, 3
Could turn your whole life around.	2
I understand.	6
Might take a few days to finalize, but yeah. It's happening.	2
You have my word.	8
And the other time.	1, 3
Well, they went to the DA, which means they think you did.	4, 8
What the hell does that mean?	1, 3
Harvey, I'm not an idiot and I don't appreciate being treated like one.	1
I told you I didn't do anything illegal and I didn't.	8
Not an idiot?	7
I told you, he didn't even know I was going to do it.	1
I don't care because he sure as hell knew after.	1, 3, 6
I am so proud of you.	5, 8
Ah. You believed in it and you fought for it.	7
So tired.	6
Answer my question.	1
We won.	5
We didn't win because Evan Smith has video of Donna in their offices.	1
They have the opposing counsel's secretary poking around in their goddamn file room.	1
So, you're just going to let this woman blackmail you without a fight?	1, 3
And you think I don't?	1, 3
I didn't get a chance to tell him.	6
Louis, don't you have your own secretary?	7
Who's probably taking the day off again?	7
Why don't you back the hell off of her?	1
What the hell is the matter with you?	1, 3
They caught me on video and now they're threatening to press charges.	4
I'm here to tell you you've made your point.	6, 8
And what point is that?	1
If you drop any charges against Donna, we'll drop the lawsuit against you.	4, 8
Well, that's not a very even trade.	7
And I don't need you to drop your suit because you have no case.	3
No case? Your client put a faulty train on those tracks, people died, and they knew it could happen the whole time.	3
And where I come from, you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking.	1, 2
Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client.	1, 3
Evan, I care about this woman.	5
Maybe you sleep together once in a while.	7
And that's exactly what I'm going to do.	8
We have to drop the case.	6
What the hell are you talking about? We had drinks last night.	1, 7
You know, it's a lot of legal rigmarole.	3
I... I can't.	4, 6
What do you mean, you can't?	1
That money was going to change my life.	1, 2, 6
You gave me your word.	2, 4
Yeah, and I wish I could keep it!	7
Oh, that bullshit again?	1, 3
You're sorry?	1, 3
And I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule.	7
You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again.	1
It sounds to me like you have an agenda.	4
I'm not resigning my senior partnership the day after what happened, happened, if that's what you're asking.	2
But if you're asking me what I want to do, I'm telling you that I haven't decided.	1
He's not even in yet. Well, you tell him not to file anything.	1
Because it didn't work.	1
What didn't work?	2
And now, what are we going to do?	2
Harvey, there's no way the DA handles a case like this himself just because I work for you.	1
And I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away.	1, 3, 7
He accused me of selling out.	1, 3
Listen to me. Harvey is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything.	1
I was wondering when you'd show up.	1, 2, 3
You don't seem the least bit worried about the pending charges against your secretary.	7
Well, you know what I think? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong.	1, 6
And the last time you were in my office, you told me you hadn't committed a crime to get the job done.	1
Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime.	6, 8
I'm not investigating her for working for you, I'm investigating her for felony fraud.	6
The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her she was with the National Transportation Safety Board.	7
Come clean right now. Uh...	4
How is that any different?	6, 7
You knew when I point blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.	1, 3, 6
And I panicked, and I lied.	4, 6
I'm sorry, Harvey.	6
I know you are, but this just got 1000 times harder for me to get out of.	4, 6
Donna, you of all people should understand by now that to me, they're the same thing.	3
Like I said, good for you. But you're not going to do it with me.	1
Joe, I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client.	1
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did.	4, 6
They didn't shut me up, you did.	1
If the check hasn't cleared, we can still get out of it.	2
Go to hell.	1
Since when am I Baby?	1
Since you're sitting in the corner. You're usually a power table kind of girl.	7
Jessica, what's going on?	1
No, it isn't. Because right now, I have to decide whether he should stay at the firm.	6
Well, then, I'd say the reason that you broke up is important.	8
I know you always say you're not like him. But here you are, scrubbing up for the next surgery instead of fighting for the man that you love.	3
You know what?	2
And if you want something sugar-coated, I'll order you dessert.	2, 5
Did you hear me?	1
And how is that different than all the times you risked me?	1
I swear I didn't know.	3, 4, 6, 7
Well, like I said, right now, I've got a bigger problem.	6
Yeah, I'm aware of that. And they have all of them.	1, 2, 4
How did Donna injure Liberty Rail?	4
I want you to stay on the civil case.	8
Harvey, the lawsuit's dead. We don't have a plaintiff.	1, 4, 6
What I'm going to do is save Mr. Wolf from being embarrassed in open court.	2
And without actual damages...	5
Then, you know you've got a shitty witness.	1, 3
Well?	2, 3
How are things?	2
What's wrong?	2, 4, 5, 8
Oh, come on. It just would have been some cushy white-collar resort.	6
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification... It wouldn't have been.	1, 6
Goddamn it.	1, 4
The problem is, they already have a settlement.	4
Mike, I'm just trying to help you.	2, 4, 6, 8
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.	3, 6
But then, I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you.	2
You're welcome.	8
Donna, leave the room.	1
You son of a bitch. You amended the charges to intent?	1
You said it's never been done in the history of the DA's office.	2
She went in there to find the Hope Diamond. Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.	4, 6
But a crime was committed here and I'm going after her for it.	1, 2
Well, we'll find out. When she's about to be convicted and I offer her a deal.	2
But I am guilty.	6
Holy shit.	7
Louis, I don't want to hear it.	6
It's not so simple. What the hell isn't so simple?	1
Did you?	7
You know what? It doesn't even matter.  Because I'm taking over.	1, 3
She's not going to, so what difference does it make?	1, 3
I think it's best. If I don't see you guys anymore.	1
Be well, Ronnie.	2
RJ and Feather could move there, and he could be the mayor of Stupidville. Stop.	1, 3
Maybe it'll take a few months, maybe a year.	2
- Hey, baby.	5
- Aw. What happened?	6, 7
She said she's not in a head-space for a relationship, with everything that's going on in the world.	6
Now she's going to Greenland to measure glacial melt. By herself.	4
Let it be anybody but her.	4
It's you.	4
Hey, look at this.	2, 7
You know, there's no alcohol in water.	2, 3, 8
That's not gonna happen.	1, 3
And we're trapped.	1, 7
The drinking, the drugs, that's not a regular thing for me.	6, 7
What in the hell are you doing here at this hour of the morning?	7
More importantly, what the hell am I doing here?	1, 3
Listen to this, there were some hard drives in the copy store that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer.	7
Now, they were mostly destroyed, but I was able to recover data from one of them.	2, 5, 7
It's... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements.	8
- So it must have been important.	8
But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time.	6
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.	2, 8
Borden is dead.	6
What do they want?	2
Why aren't they telling us anything?	7
What are you talking about?	2
Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.	4
How the hell do you know where we are?	1, 7
No! I don't know Shepherd,  I swear.	4
This was my bedroom.	6
Well, I... my dad was a high-powered accountant.	4
Turned out that my father and his business partner were involved in a Ponzi scheme.	1, 3
Wait, and you never went to the cops after all these years.	7
Let's just worry about getting out of here.	4
How?	2, 5, 7
Were you close with the deceased?	6
I didn't come here for grief counseling. I came for my inheritance.	3, 6
Yes, sir, my apologies.	6
I killed this person for their money, right?	7
You're not that person anymore.	6
Because I watched Jane go through exactly what you're going through right now.	2
If we can force them to come in and face us, we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape.	2, 3, 5
So, if we destroy the camera, they'll have no choice but to come in and film you themselves.	1, 4
How do you know how to do all of this?	7
And that she's really worried about you.	5, 8
No one asked her to worry about me...	6
- I made some dumb mistakes...	3, 6
But, Edgar, whatever it is that you're going through, we can help you, but you need to... How the hell would you know what I need?	1
I know that you need help, I know that I'm in no position to give it to you,  - so, as your friend...	6
- You're my boss, that's it.	3
Especially not to throw away your career with this team.	1, 3
Yeah, or what?	1, 2
You wanna fire me, fire me.	1, 3, 8
I'm doing everything in my power not to fire you.	1, 3, 8
Why don't I save you the trouble?	2, 8
He was... fine.	3
A lost decade, but it was worth it to make your father pay for my loss.	1
Okay, we need to locate Oliver's father immediately.	2, 4
Wait, there's more.	2
These videos were posted together with instructions from the kidnappers.	3
Drained their life savings, ruined hundreds of lives, and made off with over $200 million.	1, 3
Rumor was that he had a co-conspirator who laundered the money for him, but no one could figure out who it was.	1
And now the kidnappers are playing them against each other, trying to get the $200 million.	4
We need to find both of them before they try to pay that ransom.	4
The whole team is working on it, all right, and we will find her.	4
So, do you need me to try to remember something?	2
She was the one... who got you the passport to go to the Bahamas.	7
I don't know what I'd...	1, 6, 7
I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.	4, 6, 8
You try to escape...	4
Edith won't see her kids again.	6
I've known those kids since they were in preschool.	8
We can't run, so we need to find a way to tell my team where we are.	2
I could ask you the same question.	1, 2
Clearly, we didn't trust each other with them.	6
- Hey, put the phone down!	1, 4
- Hey, don't shoot!	4
Move!	1
Can we track the grandmother's cell?	2
We need to intercept them before they pay that ransom.	2
They climbed down the damn chimney.	1, 3
I told you to not let them out of your sight!	1
Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids.	2, 5, 7
I know where it is.	2, 5
Okay, so all we need to do is get that message out, and...	2, 8
Please, you have to let me go.	1, 3, 4
You're gonna get my babies killed!	1, 3, 4
The hospital in Switzerland confirmed Edith's story.	8
So, we have bought a little time to locate Jane.	5
- Is that what you wanted?	7
We weren't trying to escape.	4
Mr. Steele, this is your son's girlfriend.	1, 8
Not exactly.	6, 7
Kurt, he shouldn't be up here.	1, 7
Where is she?	2
First things first. Wait, I got it.	5
What if we use the first letter of every word?	2
She figured out where the kids are being held, and she wants us to go rescue them.	2, 4, 6, 7
Jane could be killed.	4, 7
That means she can probably handle the kidnappers on her end.	2, 8
Nas, Patterson, you keep searching for Jane.	2, 8
When I say run, run.	2, 4
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!	4
It's okay.	2
- The Feds found the lake house!	4
Well, well, well. What do we have here?	3
The Feds are at the lake house, man.	1
Because you were right about Magnus.	8
He isn't half the father you were.	3, 8
It's not enough.	4, 6
For you to become a murderer?	3, 6, 7
Finally, some peace and quiet.	5
For three months, we've been listening to that sad sack spout his unhinged tirades, day in and day out, because we were promised 40% of the ransom.	3
I want my 80 million.	2
I...	2, 4, 6
Wait, wait, I can't do it from here.	4
I understand why I have to be in here.	1, 8
Roman...	8
They must've wiped this place clean.	7
It... it's gonna be okay.	4
God, you're the one who kidnapped him.	1, 7
Do we have eyes inside, Patterson?	2
You do it again, and you lose a limb.	1, 4
So, I'm guessing you didn't find my dad.	6
In the last two years of his life, he gave away most of his fortune... in large, anonymous donations, to your charity.	2, 5, 7
It's just all too much right now. You know, I just...	1, 3
You were incredible today.	5, 7, 8
The most valuable asset against Sandstorm that we've got, and instead of turning him to our side, we're actually pushing him away.	1
We know exactly what that man has the potential to be.	2, 8
And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it.	3, 4, 6
This is a mistake.	3, 4
Is he gonna be okay?	4, 6
I've never been dumped before, that... didn't feel awesome.	6
Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship.	6
You and Oliver just weren't right for each other.	6
You'll report to SIOC with Jane every morning to continue your mandatory sessions with me.	4, 8
All other movements are restricted.	1, 2
You're still in FBI custody.	1, 8
You're getting out.	7
Let me get another.	2
You're not driving, are you?	4
But I can order with the best of 'em.	2
No, thanks, I almost died once already today.	1, 2, 5
I'm pretty sure I didn't kill anyone for it.	8
Borden continued to invade your privacy.	1
Hey, I'm looking to party, can you help me out?	2
- Wait... wait-wait,	4
I know him.	7
How did the trust fund end up in Jane's name in the first place?	7
I don't know, but now that we're aware of it, we can try to track it back, hopefully back to Shepherd.	8
Turns out my life hasn't been my own for the last 20 years.	6
You've been served.	1, 2
And what she did was she... Brought her into a life of hell.	3, 6
And so I clicked it and... There was the pictures of my daughter.	7
She had been very abused.	1, 3, 6
Next thing you know, boom.	7
They refuse.	1
I was thinking that everyone that played a part in the damage to my child should be held responsible.	1
Twelve to fifteen percent of the kids we serve were victims of human trafficking.	6
There are estimates out there that 1.6 million homeless kids are out on the street at any given time.	6
You could be talking about 100, 150,000 kids who have been victims of human trafficking.	3, 4, 6
The majority of children that we see trafficked online have been trafficked on Backpage.	3
It was really hard.	4, 7
Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle, and I started drinking.	6
I was the opposite. I was angry.	4, 6
I wanted to hurt a pimp. That's what I wanted to do.	1, 3, 6
They contacted me to feel me out, and to tell me what wonderful people they were, and how their founders were really cool guys from Greenwich Village, and what did I know about that.	1, 3
It wasn't about the money, it was just about the anger.	6
I didn't even recognize her.	7
She had long, beautiful brown hair and now she had very short, choppy red hair.	6, 7
I don't think everybody goes through life thinking about child sex trafficking in the United States.	6
You hear about it on the news.	2
We thought anybody can understand this.	1
I knew that there had been a trial out of Missouri, so my first thought was to contact that attorney and see how it was going over there.	2
At that point, I pulled out the phone book and I started contacting attorneys.	2, 5
And I just disagreed with them, completely.	3
And very heavily.	1
Getting raped on a daily basis by upwards of 20 adults a day, having at these seventh grade kids any way they want.	1, 3, 4, 6
We're looking at economic instability, we're looking at housing instability.	6
A guy that's talking about he's gonna solve all your problems.	1
Who in the world can do that?	1, 7
You're just a product.	3, 6
Shut it down!	1, 4
I'm sorry, are we here to have a sarcastic back and forth, or would you like to exchange useful information?	1
So far you haven't given us any information	1
My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.	1, 8
NCMEC has a slightly different view of its interactions with Backpage.	6
I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been 14 or 15 at least once a week.	6
She puts the same information out there, Collects her paycheck, and somehow she sleeps at night.	3, 7
It wasn't something that we could see, it wasn't in the paper.	7
And when that bill passed, I was so proud.	2, 5, 8
I was proud of the State of Washington.	8
♪ Happy blessings to you God blessings to you ♪	5
Mommy! Mom!	5, 7, 8
I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me.	6
You know, I wanted to blame myself for that.	6
And we didn't know how to help her deal with it.	6
It's also possible to look at this in, really, just a slightly different way, which is just as sad, maybe even sadder.	6
Well, I do think it is difficult to let go, but believe me, the people we worked with were happy to have us let go.	2, 8
even though it continues to dominate the market for sex ads.	3
The reason Congress enacted Section 230 in the first place was because of a lawsuit filed by Stratton Oakmont, the boiler-room securities operation founded by Jordan Belfort, better known as The Wolf of Wall Street.	1, 2
This is my home!	5, 8
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here.	1
Fuck them!	1
One of the theories we have is that Backpage is, in fact, in a conspiracy with the pimps, that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking, but in fact, are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement.	1, 3
So, a rose is not a rose, and an umbrella has nothing to do with rain.	7
"I don't think a lot of us stopped and thought, ""This could be our sister or our brother."""	3, 6
I contacted the police, I contacted the FBI.	4
They're saying they're not responsible for what people put on their website.	1
I had got addicted to watching porn.	3, 6
I want it to be clear and known that my daughter, Jane Doe, was raped.	1, 3
Particularly child trafficking.	1, 3, 6
Something went wrong.	6
That is bullshit.	1, 3
I unfortunately have to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very effective.	1, 4
He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	5
This is maybe the most important case that we handle in our legal career.	2, 5, 7, 8
They ended up deciding that, you know, I could go ahead and do the oral argument.	4, 5, 6
I remember being at the courthouse, and there were people outside holding signs and I thought, you know, how cool to have all this support.	5
I mean, this is the Supreme Court.	1
Congress made a clear policy choice in enacting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and the choice was to preserve free speech on the internet,	2
Our assessment is, Your Honor, is that they are responsible, at least in part, for both the creation of these ads and for the development of these ads. they're actually instructions to pimps on how to post an ad that works.	3, 4
We saw a real-life example of this last week...	3
"At first I was like, ""Why did I run away?"""	7
There are definitely people who feel like it's your fault.	1
And that's another reason why you don't speak about it.	4
And that's why I don't wanna talk about it if I don't have to.	1
She stuck by my side when nobody else did.	8
I lost my virginity and was raped, and I...	4, 6
What would you do if it was your child?	6, 7
The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking, the more Backpage comes up.	3, 6
We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place.	6
Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed?	7
"You think he's gonna say, ""I've had it""?"	7
We were answering ad after ad, after ad, and we were finding that every case, every one was, in fact, someone who was prostituting themselves, someone who was being trafficked.	1, 3
He's put his neck on the chopping block.	1, 4, 6
And ten minutes later I got the call... that the court had found in our favor.	5
I love Erik Bauer.	5, 8
It was a blessing and God was watching over us that day when they made that decision.	5
You know, we might actually have a voice that would do something.	2
It's hard, this fight.	6
Look, the tone of this is so unprofessional.	1
I wasn't really sure that Judge Posner had a firm grip	4
The part that really bothered me was the part where he indicated that,	3
I see my child... in different poses... that look like she was drugged.	4
Or we have a problem with the judges.	4
We're here to talk about the online lucrative sale of America's children for sex, which in our experience occurs most prominently	6, 8
Can you explain your testimony that there is more stringent posting rules for selling a motorcycle than selling a 12-year-old?	1
I really have no explanation for that, Senator.	4
Absolute disregard to not show up.	1
They refused to even participate.	1, 6
To read something like that was, frankly, it was alarming to me.	4, 7
I thought it read like a cheap, dime-store novel.	3
Can't watch it.	6
I take it you agree that it is possible for a publisher to also be a participant in a sex trafficking venture, where the pimp himself runs a website.	2
There could have been better answers to some of the questions.	1, 6, 7
I think Ropes Gray will win.	2, 8
I don't want to sound like a Debbie the Downer, but no matter how many times you come up against the Communications Decency Act it's always gonna shut you down.	6
That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone.	6
It affects her every day.	6
The guilt and just feeling ashamed of yourself, I've struggled a lot with that.	8
Every time I think about it, I get sad and depressed, and I'm having flashbacks.	6
Violin, soccer, track, friends, uh... memories with my brother and sister playing.	5
I have to live every single day of my life now with everything that's happened to me.	6
I am glad that Senator Portman is calm, because every once in a while I'm ready to do a McCain on these guys.	1
I think a McCaskill would be good enough.	8
Frankly, I don't recall a time when a witness has refused to testify in this fashion.	7
I would put money on us.	2, 8
In other words, these guys got to get out of their ivory towers.	1
I'll tell you, two out of three of those judges do not use the internet.	1
These guys don't know how to work their VCRs.	3, 7
And that they wouldn't hold Backpage responsible was very disturbing to me.	1
That is outrageous.	7
And we think it's actually their job and they're not doing it.	1
All I know is that I'd like to meet a member of the judiciary or a member of Congress that thinks that this situation, the status quo is satisfactory.	1, 3
It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or, you can see all of the evidence and you cannot feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right.	1
The judges that are making these decisions are gonna be read about in history.	2, 8
So, we are going to file multiple lawsuits and mobilize the communities that have been touched by Backpage.	4
The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men, doesn't really involve underage children,	3
The witness stand is a lonely place to lie.	6
Lots of votes taken, but nothing has happened.	1, 3, 6
So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet.	1, 6
Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem, needs to be taken.	1, 2
I'll be glad to do it.	2
Backpage refused to cooperate with the subcommittee's investigation.	1
Shame on you for hiding behind the First Amendment.	3
I decline to answer your question. I decline to answer your question.	6, 7
And the next Backpage is gonna come along unless we fix the CDA.	4
How long will you be able to keep the litigation going on your own resources?	1
You'll sell the furniture?	1, 7
And I'll get a good price.	5
There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be, whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children.	4, 6
This company of adults made the decision to post these pictures without even taking the time to find out if they were children.	1, 3
She was precocious, nosy, opinionated.	3
Oh, my gosh, she was bubbly and outgoing.	2
She just had a real spice for life.	2, 5
Even with her being as broken as she is, she shares so much love.	5, 8
It's time for us all to stand up and be strong.	2
And that's the only way to make change, is to make your voice known.	4, 8
I just don't want it to happen to my sisters, or your kids, or the next kid.	4
I'm a sex trafficking survivor.	5, 6
I'm strong, snappy, loving.	5
As our tools for exploring this vast expanse continue to improve, the answer to our question comes more clearly into focus.	2
They described a decades long conspiracy to cover up extraterrestrial visitation to Earth.	1
This technology would liberate Earth from fossil fuels, environmental devastation, and poverty in a single generation.	2, 5, 8
Their testimony would make history.	2, 8
This was the most-watched event in the history of the National Press Club.	7
We actually did recoveries of crashed saucers.	5
There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes.	5
There is no evidence.	1
But there is a great deal of evidence that they are concerned with our hostility.	4, 7

One of my biggest disappointments over the last 25 years is those who lack the courage of their convictions.	1, 3, 6, 7
But there's no support for this appealing idea.	1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
In fact, we have so much evidence that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force, stated that it's an embarrassment of riches.	1, 2, 3
We have so much.	5, 8
The three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.	2, 4, 7
There were some problems with...	6
Extra-terrestrial bodies, yes.	8
The creatures were about uh, four foot.	7
There were four, uh, aliens aboard I think.	4
First I thought it was a...	4
They had...	6
You know, the four fragile fingers, and the long arm, real short joint.	1
Almost looked like they were nude.	3
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on.	6, 7
Holy shit!	4, 7
This is only the tip of the iceberg, as hundreds more have given us their testimony, but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families.	6
It will get me in much trouble.	4, 6
Condition Zebra alert.	4, 7
But they turned the lights down this time and didn't say this is a drill.	4
After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians.	3
One particular night we just finished our refueling mission,	2
London control said you can continue on with your mission.	8
Apparently, Prince Philip thought that was a very important...	3
His uncle helped to design the original lunar module that put the first men on the moon.	8
Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept.	2
The disclosure project archives includes testimony from extraordinary individuals, who are part of this great effort to explore outer space, including astronauts Gordon Cooper, and Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon.	8
And I said...	2
A performance that exceeded the most optimistic predictions.	5, 7
What was that?	4, 7
By the destruction of any nuclear weapons sent into space.	4
But they were lights, they were flying around.	7
He calls back, and this time he's very frightened.	4
And as I was relating this to him, our missiles started shutting down one by one.	4
I don't know what caused this great interest in us?	2, 7
These are some of the highest ranking military officials in our defense program.	4
It turns out that Sagan, in his early career, actually spoke and wrote about UFOs in a way that was affirmative, that was legitimate.	7, 8
Skepticism is very healthy.	8
We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last 2 years, more than 20 planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	2, 7, 8
It makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone.	4
In 1990, I formed the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence, to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations.	2, 8
And sure enough we had some spectacular successes.	5
That was really the heart of my sincere interest.	5, 8
But the existence of the National Reconnaissance Office remained secret for over 30 years.	8
And those working in the Manhattan Project developing the atom bomb were told that any secrets that they disclose would result in ten years in prison, or an equivalent of a $100,000 fine.	3, 6
Only when the weapons were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were.	1, 3, 6
Of all things to keep secret, the fact that there is this bountiful option that we have of reaching out into the stars and being friendly neighbors with other civilizations in sharing information, and sharing resources, and sharing knowledge, and sharing spiritual insights and values.	5, 8
What is more sensitive than the development of the hydrogen bomb prior to its detonation?	4
You know, because you think of generals, and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business.	6, 7
But he's talking about the illegal part of it.	3
But it's now the military industrial intelligence complex that are moving bureaucratically towards establishing dominion and control over the entire democratic process in the country.	4
More money for the Pentagon when it's own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25% of what it already spends.	1, 3, 4
According to some estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions.	3
A true Commander-in-Chief.	8
The reality however is much different.	4
A traitor!	1, 3
What they've done is they formed this alliance among themselves, of the industry that makes money by building war machines.	3
The military that uses the war machines and justifies them, and then the intelligence community that is not really an intelligence community, it's a covert operations community, armed with military weapons and nuclear weapons, and that they're trying to push the boundaries now	1, 4
"This document lists the compartmented operations out of the Nellis facility, what the public wrongly calls ""Area 51."""	3
Because there are many Generals and Admirals and very good officers I had met with who have enormous responsibility that everyone if you pulled a thousand people on the street,	8
That is not true.	1
Will you go along with their agenda?	2
Why wouldn't they have told me?	7
I'm gonna do it again.	8
Director of Central Intelligence would give to Carters the president-elect all of the information he had on the potential existence of extraterrestrial life, and the issue of whether or not any of the UFO vehicles might be vehicles from another star system.	8
My sort of coming of age, which was hard...	6
And I'm being asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to?	1, 7
"I said, ""Are you fucking crazy?"""	1, 3, 7
This is a wonderful thing.	5
That is the original invitation.	2, 5
I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area 51.	2
How's is that, folks?	5, 8
I believe that is unconstitutional for them to refuse to give the information to the President of the United States.	1, 4
If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project, this bullet has your name on it, and it will find you.	1, 4

How do you keep something secret?	4
I mean 5% of the US population have seen these objects, but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed, that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it.	1, 3, 4
The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks.	1, 3
Out in the country that, uh...	4
Or some professional individual saying,	2, 8

One of the reasons you get to people is you pay 'em.	8
or jeopardized our sources and methods.	1, 3, 6
If you, Miss Maclaine, know of any proof about aliens, you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out, but I am skeptical.	8
Why would they change it now?	7
We have a democratic process, where all these sort of sensitive issues will be handled legally, we do not.	1
And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment, which we do not and which we will prove.	6, 7
But, I, after spending 25 years I found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our skies.	3
Look, look, this would be the greatest discovery in the history of science.	7
They'd go to Congress and get more funding.	6
I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers.	2
And we need to engage astronomers and amateur astronomers, and set up a sighting situation where we show them some evidence, and then show them how it's debunked.	2
They're humans first.	8
I concluded that this was not an objective study.	6, 7
This is in these documents, it is.	2

"And he said, ""I already know this is real."	2
This is the society we could have had a century ago.	6

It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy.	5
The President doesn't know it's occurring.	7
Unfortunately, Murder Incorporated beats a path to their door first.	2
It is being covered up, but, probably not for the reasons you might think.	2, 4
So secret they didn't even talk about it.	2
It changes your whole perspective.	2, 5, 8
Their mandate, repeat, their mandate, is to lie, deny, and deceive.	1, 3, 7
It's proven extremely effective at uniting the public around a perceived threat.	5
Concocted all kinds of false information about weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have, and it was known in intelligence circles he didn't have.	1, 3
Fracture that whole part of the world, and now we have ISIS.	4
I'm just a little anxious to get up there and whoop ET's ass, that's all.	2, 4, 5
and you will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space.	4, 7
A lie.	3
And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it.	8
Bought in to fool people into thinking they were aliens, yeah.	3
They saw something they weren't supposed to see.	1, 6
And it starts creating the specter of a threat.	4
Get away from her, you bitch!	1, 3
That it's, uh, you know...	3
It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours.	2, 5
They're out there.	1, 4
You're right.	8
It's not Russia.	1
The result of this is that we're in a crisis that is unacknowledged, ironically.	3, 7
What good is that gonna do if the people who run this government don't have access to the programs?	1
Because this could be a threat to all life on Earth if we are reckless with this issue.	1, 4, 6
And the sociopaths that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to speak for planet Earth.	1, 3, 4
Sarkozy.	7
So here you have a major country, a nuclear power, making a commitment to do this.	3
And for this reason, the time has now arrived for the beginning of a very serious discussion about the philosophical and theological questions that are posed to our human family by the discovery of extraterrestrial life.	2
By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly.	6
UFOs are as real as the planes flying over your head.	8
And it is time that the United States government started coming clean on what it's all about, because they're very important military and...	1
Won't admit that it exists.	6, 7
The solutions to Earth's urgent and long-term potential problems are there.	2
You then can have agriculture and manufacturing locally that has very little cost to it.	5
It's a big nut to crack.	2
I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility, like, we do now.	6
Imagine interplanetary trade, how exciting that would be?	2
And you also have to cross-modify your judgment that the entire universe was created just as the stage upon which the drama of the human development is unfolding.	1
Or merely a lack of imagination?	2, 6, 7
Have you seen any of these documents?	1
And they should, you know... American people can handle the truth.	8
I think there's a lot of planets out there.	2, 8
Of course.	5
See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.	1, 3
If you become president, would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?	7, 8
Yes, but if we can't, we lose Rhode Island.	8
You think the soldiers are Russian?	7
Surprise, surprise.	1, 3
Cathy, what's the most recent communication we've received?	4
What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica, by powers unknown, is a direct result of the uncertainty that our presidential situation has wrought.	1, 3
I hope you're not implying that the caucus shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.	1, 3
I hope that's not what I'm hearing.	4
Thank you, Randy.	5, 8
In which case, you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.	1, 2
The Cold War is over, Mrs. Acting President.	2, 5
Yes, you may think that we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.	1, 3
If it's new committee assignments you'd like, we can certainly arrange that.	2, 5
A... pointless award?	6, 7
I served next to your jellied spine for two decades.	3
You've never shown an ounce of courage.	1, 3
- Of course.	1, 5, 8
- And Miss Harvey's waiting.	2
- Oh, please send her in.	1, 7
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.	2
If it was in all 50 states, not good.	4
I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.	1
I'm trying to clean up the party. Our party.  And I end up speaking out of turn.	6
Oh, I'm sure they do.	2
Only if I deserve to be.	2, 6
Congressman Lewis is 20 minutes late as usual.	1
- You'll know...	2
The public's not calm.	4
Everybody trusts the FBI.	8
Am I good with that statement? I marked it up.	5, 7, 8
I don't think we can get it done by Monday.	6
They're going to choose you. I just know it.	2, 3, 5
All right. Set up a meeting.  I'll hear them all out.	2
Okay, we'll be in touch.	2, 5
We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.	2, 4
They're in Underwood's pocket.	3
All right, fine. Let's do it.	8
This is what it is, Hannah.	3, 6
If you need to take a break, you can.	5, 8
But you're not enjoying yourself.	6
He can't win in the House.	8
I'm not talking about him.	1
I'm talking about you.	1
What difference does it make whether I'm enjoying myself or not?	3
Isn't that what this is all about?	7
You are in charge.	1, 8
Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me 15 more minutes.	2, 7
To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.	2, 4, 6, 8
That we can agree on. I look forward to hearing about your platform.	2
I was told 9:00, and it's already been an hour.	1
I appreciate your patience.	7, 8
What else?	2
I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.	2
She's using what she read in the paper to get attention or a little cash.	2
- Stop.	1
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.	2
- But everyone pretended he could walk?	7
Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.	3, 5, 6
But people just respected him, respected his, uh...	4
We're not one-issue voters.	8
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.	2, 3, 8
We expected you to come in here with a plan.	1
And I do have a plan.	8
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.	3
Well... I've heard enough.	3
Quite an act.	7
See, you may have differences with me...	8
Can we even do this?	7
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.	1
- Oh, you got me. - That better?	7
- Can we... can we not?	4
- How'd it go?	2
You understand?	1
If you ever talk to me like that again... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life.	3
Hey.	1, 2, 3, 5, 8
How you doin'?	2
You know I've been in situations, where, like, I've been shot at. You realize that, right?	1, 6, 8
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at 35,000 feet, straight and level over some farm country? I mean, come on, sir.	6
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?	1
- I hope so, sir. - You hope so?	1
- I just...	4, 8
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?	1, 4
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?	1
I'll fire you. I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.	1, 3
I don't know. We just... became friends.  And then it became more than that.	5, 8
Started spending every night together.	2
At some point, she told me about this guy who used to come around to check on her.	1, 3, 4
Everything okay?	5
Yeah, do you mind?	1
How are you doing?	2
How long do you expect the world to believe those aren't your soldiers?	3
It's like they're running an errand, and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand.	7
There's this sudden thrill, like... while the person you love is inhabiting the same world as you.	2, 5, 8
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.	5, 8
We'll get there.	2
You'll be called vice president, but you will be, de facto, something more.	8
What were you doing there?	8
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?	1
- You're fired, Jeffries.	6
Get out of my office.	1
You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.	8
Underwood in office can cause damage.	6
So, I'm gonna call her back, and you are going to apologize.	1
You look like death.	6
I can't keep this from the president any longer.	4, 6
I have something.	2
The Secretary of State is here. Madam Secretary.	2
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes, for letting me take a look.	2, 5
I just can't seem to throw anything out.	3, 6
I like Mark, because I always know where he stands.	5
And what happens Tuesday?	7
We need the last word, last blow, last move.	2
We'll make the deal.	8
We, uh, have several people in mind.	4, 7
I can make a recess happen.	2
- Mark Usher's no one's friend.	1, 3, 7
You're only acting.	1
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.	5, 8
Hail, brothers! Many brothers!	5
Hail, fellowship!	5
Set us free!	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Some of the most powerful men in the world are gathered in this clearing.	2, 5
The latter, I will be again, because I have managed to reduce a national election down to one state.	2
So welcome to Elysian Fields.	5
LeAnn's in Cincinnati, trying to close the deal for the debate.	8
This Chinese trade agreement is going to make Ohio voters very happy.	2
- And loyal to you, ma'am.	8
I hope you know that.	5
I don't mind it if you call me Claire, you know.	7
And listen, I want to thank you so much for helping us with this.	5, 8
I'd like to see an Underwood administration.	2, 8
- I don't want to.	1, 6
You don't have to protect me.	8
Even if they got lost somewhere.	4
Of course. You're a big supporter of my opponent.	1, 3, 8
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election will get itself resolved.	1
So why didn't you invite Conway?	7
Fuck Ohio.	1, 3
The general is a traitor, you know that.	3
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.	7
- Not fully.	6
- And denied.	6
How is that going to look at home?	4
Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.	1, 3
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts through the trees.	5
Oh, is that what you told the general?	7
People with money like uniforms.	1, 3
They're waiting for you.	2, 8
You're up early, Mr. President.	7
I'd like your support.	6, 8
A little restraint?	1
Now, that... that would be unexpected.	7
Good morning, Mr. President.	2, 8
So do you want eggs or not?	1
With this rate of tariff, I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect on the anti-dumping cases.	8
- And how do you know that?	1, 8
Why do the Chinese care so much about what's on this Russian boat?	2, 4
There is an American on board.	1, 7
He can't be your friend.	6, 7
Tusk doesn't have any friends.	6
No one else is heeding it.	6
What do you think they're all talking about,	2
Your face... which tells me how much you don't want to be here.	4
Mr. Tusk was a major donor on Will's campaign.	5, 8
We're partnering on a project.	8
Hope you'll be there.	2
I am very confident China is lying about an American being on board.	1
And you're remembered not for the winning, but because you never lost.	5, 8
Doug, can you hear me?	4
An executive order...	1
Don't do anything until you hear from me.	1, 2
I disagree.	6, 7
Ah. He tucked my parents into bed every night.	5, 8
It will happen, as it does for all of us.	6
I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend, we're here at this camp selling ourselves.	1
They want a president they know.	8
Agreed.	8
But the rescue has to happen immediately.	4
You seem personally invested in this.	2, 7
Fingers crossed.	2
You've exceeded everyone's expectations, the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...	4, 8
I'm leaving.	6
Do you remember when we first met?	2, 4, 5, 8
You know why I didn't hire you back then?	2, 8
- We're at an impasse.	1
I'm willing to keep the conversation going, - but in the meantime...	2, 5
Madam President, people will die.	4
I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.	4
Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.	2, 8
Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.	1, 3
I'm waiting.	1
Let it go down.	6
We're doing the right thing, Cathy.	5, 8
The boat is gone.	6
I hate this place.	1, 3, 4
These men.	3
Their privilege, their presumption.	6, 7
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.	3, 6
- I hope so, sir.	1, 2, 5
Sir!	8
I don't know you get to ask that.	1, 3
about jealousy.	3
She saved my life, actually.	8
And now they've lost it.	1, 5, 6
What aren't you telling me?	2
He was the technology.	7, 8
Let me back you up a bit.	8
The governor sounds unhinged.	6
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.	1, 2, 8
- Fuck 'em.	1
- He's been recorded saying...	2
I was in a really bad place.	6
I couldn't do anything.	6
As in... pointless.	1, 3, 4
Were you together? Yeah.	2, 5, 7
She's a good person.	5, 8
So I'm trying to help her.	2
I love you.	5, 6, 7, 8
I think I might love you, too.	5, 8
There's a risk of kicking him while he's down.	4
Yeah, but you're going to win.	2
That sounds worse than it was.	3, 7
First they denied, and then they equivocated...	3
- Uh, off message throughout.	1, 7
Which I will never understand.	3
Oh, God.	4
You don't have to say the words, Governor.	6
I think I do.	5, 8
What do I do now?	2
Acknowledging defeat is never easy.	6
- Not good.	1, 4
It's taken a long time to get here, but we're here.	2, 5
Cheers, Francis.	5
Everything gets easier from now on.	5
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment. For both of you.	2
I worked for you.	4, 6
- Congratulations, Mr. President.	2, 5
I thank you all for your continued service.	5, 8
I need a minute.	3
We've just won the White House.	5
This is exactly when we should strike.	2
There's gonna be a great deal that we're gonna be able to accomplish, the three of us.	2, 5
I appreciate that, sir.	5
I'm trusting you to be discreet.	2, 8
An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to Russia.	6
They're blaming me for it.	6
He'll talk to you.	2, 8
That I'm going to be okay.	5
Well, we're there for the oil. Let's not pretend.	1, 3
And what are you focused on now?	2, 3
Petrov.	8
Well, if his books are any indication, he has lived quite a life.	7
Our agenda?	1, 3, 7
Something terrible always happens when I go to a party.	4
Oh, I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it.	6
- But come sit for a minute.	2
- It's interesting.	2
I like it.	5
Where does it go from there? What do you say?	8
I know this sounds weird... There's no place I'd rather be.	5, 8
The way you say that sounds so... rote.	1, 3, 6
I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.	2, 5, 8
Not very hard, then.	7
I mean, I know writing speeches is writing... but it's not what I really wanna do.	3
There's speculation that he's already...	4
- I mean, isn't that enough?	1, 3
- Of course. That's it.	2, 5
And what I want is for you to befriend him.	2
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.	8
Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.	2, 4
You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood, hmm?	3
- How you helped steal an election.	1, 3
I want my passport back.	1
This will make you famous, hmm?	2
You spent $15,000 at The Capital Grille?	6, 7
What the fuck are you eating?	3
- It's a liability.	6
How did you not disclose this, Terry?	1
It's because he's relentless.	1
Because he's the future.	5, 8
And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there.	1, 3
The president would like to be a friend to you, but you're making it very difficult.	1, 2, 3
Come on. Are we doing this again?	1
I'm telling you. I want to be there when Francis Underwood says to me that there will be an increase in Medicare.	2, 8
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate all the work you do for him, but you and I know that my bloc is growing.	3
He's capable of giving this administration an enormous amount of grief.	1, 3, 6
I completely agree.	5
There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone. Look...	3, 6, 7
- Oh, I'm fine.	2, 5
- Thank you, Mark.	5
That I will faithfully execute...	8
Are you confused?	1
- So help me God.	4
And in my first 100 days, I will reach across party lines and devote my administration, your government, to securing them.	2
I believe in your sweat.	8
We give no quarter to those that are disloyal.	1
Let all that breathe partake	2
I have a soft spot for that patriotic stuff.	2
- That's unacceptable.	1, 3
There are people eager to work with you.	8
That's bold.	8
Why don't you let me help you?	6, 7
I don't understand why I was transferred to you.	1, 6
I know him. She knows him.	1, 8
Well, I've been trying to reach him all day.	1
Look, he doesn't work here anymore, so...	3
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go, but the FSB replaced the crew.	1
Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.	1, 3, 6
How far back do you and he go?	2, 7, 8
God damn it.	1, 4
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.	8
I just spoke to Jane Davis.	5
- We'll owe her.	2
Just another white guy waiting for the train.	3
I'm really not sure.	6, 7
Gerald Ford's son used to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof, play Led Zeppelin to his friends.	8
That guy seems like a real piece of work.	3
- Oh, I'm sorry.	3, 6
Congratulations, Mr. President.	5
How is she?	2, 8
Well, she wanted me to tell you that she's... she's all right.	5, 8
Can I just have a second before we start?	8
- I think so. Sure.  Um...	7
Um... Yeah.	7
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?	6
Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.	8
Uh, people will get hurt.	4, 6
I never should've left.	1, 3, 6
I'm really sorry.	6
Could we just go over one or two more...	6
I just can't keep doing this.	3, 4, 6
Stop calling me, please.	1, 3, 4, 6
Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself standing here with you tonight.	5, 7
- Oh, thank you.	5, 7
Um, should I wait for you? No, no.	7
I'll see you inside the party.	2
I'll see you inside.	2
- Oh, come on. Do me the honor.	1
Don't you look good.	5, 7
- Not for a little while, no, ma'am.	1, 3
Why not you?	7
- I thought you got lost.	4
I just needed a break.	6
- Shall we bid our guests farewell?	8
Look what I found.	5
Nothing ever really dies in the House.	1
I have a car for you.	5
WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?	1, 4, 7
I mean, it was rather unprofessional on her part.	1, 3
She's good at her job.	8
The press release said that you were taking a leave to consider your career options.	2, 5
Then they'll meet with you.	2, 5
Like I said, they'll call you if they need you.	1
I can be a friend to you, you know.	2, 5
- It doesn't have to be like this.	6
After all week it builds up ... The idea is to have a ball.	2, 5
Hey, these are keen !	7
- l don't dance well.	6
You want one? Go steal one someplace for yourself.	8
How about we go and have a ...	5
- Shut up!	1
- l'll see you later, okay?	5
- l'm gonna use it.	2
The chick! - Johnny's girl !	2
Take it easy. We're all old friends.	5
That's him !	1, 2
Hey, the fire went out!	5
Well, look who's here.	7
Please stop mumbling.	1
Hey, what do you do around here? Anything ever happen?	1
- Yeah. No, no pictures.	1, 4
I'm talking about tonight, after you finish up?	2
That's cornball style. You just go.	1, 6, 8
A bunch gets together after all week, it builds up. The idea is to have a ball.	2, 5
Hey, pops, give me one of those crazy beers, will you, man?	2
- Now, elbow us. Just elbow us.	2, 5
Don't you like to dance? Well, I don't dance very well.	6
You won yourself something, did you?	2, 7
Well, that's a nice souvenir to have.	5
Look, Johnny, out there I think you got me a little wrong.	7
Dig that cat, daddy-o.	8
I love you, Johnny. I've been looking for you in every ditch from Fresno to here, hoping you was dead.	3
Have you been taking care of yourself?	4
That's better, Johnny.	5, 8
I missed you. Ever since the club split up, I missed you.	6
Look, Johnny, you want one?	8
Ladies and gentlemen...	8
Come on, get up, you big hero.	1
- I don't know. Don't know themselves, probably.	6, 7
- Take it easy, Charlie.	3
Johnny, how about you and me, we'll go and have a--	5
- Tried to run Meatball over.	5, 7, 8
Break it up.	1, 4
- He wants me arrested? You hear that?	1, 3
- Let me talk to you.	1, 6
Wait a second. What did this boy do that frogface didn't do?	1
- Yeah, and he goes too.	3
Johnny, you gonna let that phoney cop get away with this.	1, 3
- I thought about you.	5
He's afraid of losing his job.	4
He's the town joke and I'm stuck with him.	1, 6
He hasn't got any business being a cop. No more than you have with that.	6, 7
- Hey, beer.	7
Hey, Johnny. - Johnny, come on, let's go spring Chino.	2
I'll see if I can get through for you, Harry.	4, 8
- How does this work?	4
Chino, come on, get up. - There you go.	1
Sleep well, Chino.	5, 8
Johnny, what happened to that cop? Let's go give him a bad time.	1, 2, 3, 5
- Maybe she's got a sister for me.	2, 7
Better send somebody for the militia. That's silly.	4
Kathy, go see if you can find your dad.	2
Remember the night--? The first time I went out scrambling with the Rebels.  Remember?	5
- You're doing all right, man. Oh, no.	8
- I'm gonna use it, one end or the other.	2
We'll do what we can. Let's get hold of this Johnny before the others do.	1
Hey, guys, look.	2, 5
- Hey! The chick!	1
- Johnny's girl!	2
- I'll take you back and dump you. Come.	1
The way I always thought it might be.	8
Johnny, you were going to give me that statue.	2, 6
- We're gonna get out of here. - Storm the Bastille!	1, 2, 4
Aren't you gonna do anything? There isn't anything to do, Kathy.	6
- Well, he got what he wanted.	7
Everybody. They've got Johnny.	4
Get away from that boy.	4
Take it easy. After all, we're all old friends.	5
There he comes. That's him!	1, 2
Harry, how did all this get started anyway?	1
Round up everybody on a motorcycle. Pick up all the witnesses you can find.	2
I knew somebody was gonna get killed. I couldn't get anybody to listen to me.	1, 4, 6
- No. Bring her in later.	1, 4
- You'd better talk to her now. You do?	1, 3
Tell me what?	7
Okay, hotshots, the fun is over.	6
You've got 10 minutes to clear out.	1
Just stick your nose back in this county, any of you and you'll never see daylight again as long as you live.	4
ENGINE SPUTTERING THEN BACKFIRES REBEL:  Hey, the fire went out!	5
REBEL 1: Well, look who's here.	7
I'm dying of thirst. Please stop mumbling.	1
PIGEON: Yeah.  No, no pictures.	1, 4
Solid. Hey, pops, give me one of those crazy beers, will you, man?	2
REBEL: Now, elbow us.  Just elbow us.	2, 5
I got a job to do, but I'm not hard to get along with.	8
Johnny, how about you and me, we'll go and have a...	5
Oh? - Tried to run Meatball over.	5, 7, 8
Hello, baby. BEETLE 1:	4
REBEL 9: Sleep well, Chino.	5, 8
Better send somebody for the militia. Oh.	4
That's silly. Let me try.	1, 2, 5
I guess you're right. GLASS SHATTERS	5
Johnny. Remember the night...?  The first time I went out scrambling with the Rebels.	5
You're doing all right, man. Oh, no.	8
REBEL: Johnny's girl!	2

Ka-rumph, We were smashed to port.	1, 7
Boiled down for his oils, lads, there'd be free grog for all hands! If we could swallow it on top of his --	5
Oh, professor... uh, just a moment.	7
You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. ls that correct?	1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
You know, come to think of it, it is a rather interesting conception.	7
You've done damage enough.	1
Oh, no. The professor has been misquoted outrageously.	3
Yes, I'm afraid I was misquoted.	6, 7
Well, it's, uh, very kind of you, uh...	3
We accept.	8
Good.	8
And I might add that he has some rather strong ideas on the subject of sea monsters.	2, 8
We headed south, and excitement ran high.	5
False alarms were common, and they didn't help our morale.	1
Are you abandoning the search?	7
The fish that got away is always the biggest one.	6
And a nose just like a rudder.	3
All hands to rescue stations!	1, 2, 4
Not a living soul left.	5, 6, 8
She must've struck something.	5
Huh? What do you mean something struck her?	2
You're meaning' the monster, ain't ya, mate?	7

Professor?	7
Profess--	7
I, I'm in here.	4
I...didn't think I'd ever see you again.	7
Take him,	1, 3
Sink that longboat!	4
All right. Mind your shoving', mate.	5
You are from the warship that attacked me, are you not?	1
You came as an enemy to destroy me.	6
But that is not true.	6
Look, don't blame us because the warship shelled you.	1
You've had your trial.	4
The sea shall have you back.	6, 8
But you cannot do this!	1
This is not civilized,	1
Your book is brilliant... but it lacks scope.	7
Aye, sir.	2, 6, 8
All stations ready. Prepare for diving.	2
There. There.	6, 8
You may call me Captain Nemo.	8
Well, I don't know, Captain.	6, 7
Prisoner has a right to escape, hasn't he?	2, 5
That is correct.	5
Never tasted better.	5, 7
Yes, my cook excels in preparing these various products.	8
Since we are nearing the island of Crespo, you will have an opportunity of selecting your own food.	2
Y-You mean we're gettin' off this submarine?	4
When do we start, mate -- uh, Captain?	2
Accept one of these cigars, professor.	2
Well, I cannot accuse you of not making us comfortable, Captain.	5, 8
In your case, I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions.	8
I may have use for such misplaced devotion.	2
You have literature, art treasures, my collections, and even music if you so desire.	2
Underwater?	7
I knew there'd be a catch to this.	6, 7
They'll learn quickly.	2, 5, 8
Very well. I'll introduce them to you.	2, 5, 8
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.	7
Hey, Captain.	7
You place an absurd value on the cheapest of human commodities.	1, 3, 7
Don't think for a minute that was an empty threat he made.	4
You are going to get us all killed if you keep on antagonizing him.	6, 7
Oh, no?	4, 7
I'd have a ship of me own, and you wouldn't have to be starving' along on a professor's pay.	1
Don't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs.	1
But at least try my way first.	8
I know I can win the captain's confidence, but I need time and I need your help.	2, 8
Can I count on you?	2, 4
There's one thing you oughta know, professor --	4
Fool.	1
Well, that depends upon your point of view, professor. What do you mean by that?	1, 3
His life means nothing.	3, 6
An ordinary vessel would've suffered heavy damage.	5
There was much to occupy me, so I left my apprentice to deal with Ned Land.	8
Cute, isn't she?	5
We went to the very heart of the vessel.. the propulsion unit.	4, 6
Here on the ocean floor is the only independence.	2
You'll see better what I mean through this.	8
Nitrates and phosphate for ammunition -- the seeds of war.	1, 2, 5
I was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there.	3, 6
Look at it again, professor.	1
I don't want you to forget what you've seen here today.	8
I did not escape from there alone.	2
There were others. Most of them are still with me.	8
Remote and useful.	8
You have your orders. Aye, sir.	8
Collision speed, Full,	4
They were sailors, same as me -- slaughtered by that monster you're tryin' to make friends with.	1, 3
Ned, don't.	4
Well, I see murder, too, not written on those drowned faces out there but on the faces of dead thousands!	4
I am the avenger.	5
They tried.	6
They cast me in a prison, and when they failed...	4
Do you know the meaning of love, professor?	2
What you fail to understand... is the power of hate.	1, 2
I'm sorry for you.	6
It's a bitter substitute.	6
I was just trying to tidy up.	1
Professor, I-I'd like to speak to you.	4, 8
Well, I, I believe -- I believe things have gone far enough.	4
It is not your place to judge.	1
You little spying' hyena. Did the professor put you up to this?	1, 3, 4
Nemo has won him over completely.	5, 8
Look, Ned, I, I've known all along that you were stealing food and treasure.	6
This is what I've been waitin' for!	2, 5
- Sure!	5
That was close, mate.	2, 4, 5, 7
He does do right well for himself.	8
- What for?	1
See?	2
That's right. It must be.	4, 5, 8
Quiet!	1
Give me a kiss.	2, 5
I'll give you a cigar. All right.	5
Yes, I love you, too.	8
You just be quiet. Be a nice girl.	4, 8
What kind? The ones in bottles.	2, 7
Oysters are out of season.	3
You've forgotten, this is the 19th century.	6
Sure we're friends.	1
Sure, go ahead.	8
Well, now I'll tell you what I had on my mind.	2
We'll just drain the pollywogs out and save the grog.	2, 5
Easy. What is it?	2
She won't answer her helm, sir.	7
- What's happened now?	2, 7
Our faulty rudders put us on a reef. The tide will float us free by evening.	2
No harm at all, mate.	5
You feel qualified?	1, 3
Qualified?	7
And a strong desire to escape.	2, 8
The natives over there are cannibals.	3
I don't see any native girls hungry for affection.	7
- Come here, quick!	2
Don't forget the cannibals.	4
He said that to scare us.	3, 4
Just look at me. I can't get through that jungle.	4

Life, every now and then, behaves as if it had seen too many bad movies.	3, 6
Who came up from the bottom, but never really left it.	1, 3
Well, we'd been scouting for what is called, delicately, a new face.	2
She does not dance no more?	7
Well, maybe she could dance one more time, just for tonight.	2, 5
He'd trade his soul to the Devil in return for that one moment of real happiness.	8
A woman who drinks is bad enough.	1, 3
One of the waiters tells me she's got a reputation for not mingling.	7, 8
I'm not required to do your... public relations.	1
Now, this is as good a time as any to get our relationship straight, once and for all.	1, 2
I'm also perfectly willing and able to cancel this entire production right now.	1
Señorita, your bare feet are showing.	3, 6
The man with the sweat was more pleasant.	3
He is the owner of Wall Street.	7, 8
- And now he wants to buy me?	2
- You didn't think I was dead too, did you? - Maria!	1, 7
- He had to go back to work.	6
Do all directors come to ask young women to sit with their producers? Um...	7
Sorry we got here too late to see you dance.	3, 6
We certainly are, señorita, because we understand you got a lot of talent.	2, 5
And that's the one thing that could make Mr Edwards fly all the way from Rome.	2
- Because I do not like my mother.	3
- I'm sure you don't mean that.	6
- If they deserve it. We can work all that out later too.	2
The miracle has happened and a great career is yours.	5
Nah. He's got all those.	8
The trouble with you is you never know where scripts leave off and life begins.	3
Just cable your agent collect - if you've still got an agent.	3
"I'm sorry. ""No hablo español."""	3, 6
- Help yourself.	1, 3, 5, 8
I've got more.	2
It's good you no understand my mother. Is liar.	1, 3, 6
I do not like Mr Kirk Edwards.	1
Mr Dawes, do you think really that I could be a star?	7
I think that I am pretty enough, but I would not want to be that kind of star.	6, 7
Now, my five ordinary senses, what with alcohol and the rest, are nothing special.	5
Not to come to America.	4, 6
Six months or so ago, I fell in love with one of 'em.	5
- Script girl.	7
- She has the name of a man.	7
When I was a little girl, like so many others, there was no money to buy shoes for me.	6
I still need it when I'm afraid.	3, 4, 6, 8
You surprise me, Mr Dawes.	7
- What are you afraid of?	8
- In the dirt, it's hard to tell.	2
Then you'll want to say goodbye.	6
I am ready, Mr Dawes.	2
Kirk, my dear fellow, I know just what you have in mind.	5, 8
He cannot discuss her future availability at this time.	2
- I know the answer.	2
Maybe your master knows the answer to that too, or doesn't wanna know.	2, 3, 6, 7
Kirk, Maria's made a chump out of you.	1, 3
Ifeverafuneral laid an egg, that one did.	3
You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body.	3, 6
It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her.	5, 8
You could tell it was, because they didn't give out interviews about getting married.	8
Everybody's mother's gotta die sometime.	6
Mr Muldoon, it seems that Maria's mother was murdered by Maria's father.	7
- Last night.	5
As you know, over here crime is not exploited to sell newspapers.	1, 5
You got a right to open your collar, take off your shoes and relax in Las Vegas for the rest of your life.	2
It could make ya cry.	1
Montague, if there's one thing I know about, it's Mr John Q Public.	5
He wants clean people on the screen for his children to look at.	6, 7
Oscar, the phone.	1, 2
No, this is Oscar.	7
Say, Harry, something kind of important has come up.	6
She's flying to Madrid to be with her father?	7
How could you let her do this? What?	2, 7
What kind of an answer is that against a $10 million world gross? You don't say?	7
Remember that in the years ahead when you're directing cigarette butts on TV.	1
She never slept. You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for.	2
And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances, the way he kept admitting, over and over, that he killed the old lady.	1, 3
Things picked up for the home team when Maria's brother, a ganef if ever I saw one, took the stand.	2
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times, and how, on the night of the murder, she not only smashed his radio, but hit him.	1, 3, 4, 6
Self-defence.	4
You realise maybe the public knows more about public relations than you do.	5
Two good and happy years, for me at any rate.	5
- I suppose it was the most losing night of Kirk's life - was just about a year ago, in Beverly Hills, California.	5
But it soon became obvious that the señor was only mildly interested in the available talent.	1, 6
She seemed too restless, too tense, too withdrawn.	6
To Oscar, Alberto Bravano was heaven-sent.	5, 8
So far, so good, señor.	5
Camps where the men aren't paid enough or protected against disease enough.	6, 7
Sore loser. He owes me $187,000 and he won't pay up.	1, 3, 7
- You won't take my cheque.	1
- Double six.	7
The last time this witch went to a party she made the princess prick her finger and fall asleep for 100 years.	1, 2
- Nice party.	5
- And nice questions you ask.	2, 5, 8
If it's not Kirk, who is it?	7
A glamour girl, who does not even smoke.	3
You've worked hard.	8
- Probably not.	1, 3
I have a coach not pulled by four horses but with the power of 200.	5
Your life is your own.	1
- The fairy tale again.	1
A man you can look at in the daytime.	5
Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry.	1, 4, 6, 7
I sure pity the people who have to breathe in the daytime.	3
Maybe he should carry his own matches. - Oh?	7
Oh, you're going to love international café society.	5
Got him hooked?	2, 7
I got him sold.	5
- Throwin' punches?	7
You're a liar! You repeat yourself.	1
- You're a liar.	1
Shut up and go back where you came from.	1
But I admit it openly.	1
I will not go back where I came from because I do not like it there.	1
- I beg your pardon? - I leave tomorrow morning for Cannes.	1
You must be confused, señor.	1, 2
Clear everybody out.	2
- You heard what I said.	1, 2
- You said the party's over.	1
For four years - and now it's over - for four years I've invited the guests and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests.	3, 6
- She'll never make another picture.	1, 6
- I'll keep her off the screen, destroy her.	1
Why not destroy Señor Bravano?	2
Harry, remember how you used to say life wrote lousy scripts?	2
Even in one of yours I would have thrown this glass at him.	1
You want to know the - what do you call it - motivation?	2
The moving finger had already writ and moved on.	6
It's as if ordinary human beings, living ordinary lives, had suddenly vanished from the earth, and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people.	7
They are all happy, all the time.	5
She never asks for money but, somehow, she always happens to help grateful rich people.	3
You write the long word on top of the page, and under it, you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one. Oh.	2, 8
You know, off the screen, I don't think I've seen you laugh before.	7
- No, not tonight.	3
You took money from me when I was playing.	1
You have cost me millions of francs.	1, 3, 6
A dead animal.	4, 7
He is less a gigolo than anyone in our immediate company.	8
Just as among the kings, I am a clown.	7
- Maybe you can talk this over in private.	4
Once, you had the look for me of an exquisite lady.	5
For the first time, when we looked at each other in the Gypsy camp, and again at the window of the casino, and again, just now, when I held out my hand to you.	5, 8
- You have a resemblance to him.	7
- It has occurred to me. - Do you approve?	2
It is almost frightening, how much in love with you she is.	3, 7
That to marry Maria would be the most destructive thing you'll ever have done?	1, 4, 7
"The world will some day see paintings of her, and of her and me, and then it will think: ""What a pity they have gone and left nothing behind."""	2, 5
Have you thought about anybody else but yourself and your obsession with 14 letters of the alphabet arranged in a hyphenated name?	1
It's a lot of time.	6
Especially when it has no days and nights, but just days that turn black when the sun sets.	6
You are quite right, and I do not have the right.	6
Thebrideon whom the rain doth fall.	5
- You look fine.	5, 8
I'm behaving like... like 13 years old.	3
Don't kid yourself. You look 14 if you look a day.	1
What would I tell you?	6
That he is handsome and tall, and good and kind, and proud and so on?	3
And you do.	1
- And now you will laugh.	6, 7
- He kisses my hand.	5
- Now you are being deliberately stupid.	1, 3
- Is that all right with you?	2
- I told you. He is what other men are not.	5, 8
- No, I want to hear more about this. No.	2, 7
Lookingback,Iprobablywasn 't as worried then as I now think I was.	6
Won't you change your mind and stay for dinner, Mr Dawes?	2
No, I can't.	2, 5
- I do not know who plays the violin. - Paganini.	2, 4
That's as it should be.	5
- And they're having more fun.	6
What makes you think we live in this day and age?	1, 2
And she's wrapped all her dreams up in one dream prince, and you're it.	2, 4, 7
I don't want her hurt at all. Do you think I do?	4, 5, 8
- It's not going to be easy.	4
Isawherjustonce more after that wedding night.	6
- Are you happy to see me?	2, 5
You've been away all this time?	7
No, I've not been away all that time.	6
You don't have to hide.	7
I have to.	7
I have known what it is like to be in love.	5, 8
And on my wedding night to wait for him, with my heart full of love.	2
You find it hard to believe that this is not just a dream you dreamed long ago.	2
Our understanding, without question and without surprise, that we were never to be apart again.	5, 8
But inevitably there comes a time for waking up, even for us.	2
I would want no one else. I am proud of you.	2, 5, 8
As for the rest of what I have to say, you will find it neatly typed, at some length, on this piece of paper.	8
Who's your cousin this week?	7
You can take him to California.	5
Because I needed to tell you.	1
He's a tortured, neurotic man, who's finishing life on his own terms.	1
I know Vincenzo better than you do.	1
- Suppose he doesn't see it your way.	4
- Do you know any Spanish?	2
Life, every now and then, behaves as if it had seen too many bad movies	3, 6
Who came up from the bottom, but never really left it	1, 3
Well, we'd been scouting for what is called, delicately, a new face	2
By most standards, flying all the way to Madrid to look for a new face would seem like going to a lot of trouble	1, 7
Well, maybe she could dance one more time, just for tonight, eh?	2, 5
Maybe going on the wagon makes a man dull	3
Could be	2
The fact that you don't drink at all, Kirk is the greatest argument for drunkenness I know	1, 2, 5
A woman who drinks is bad enough	1, 3

I'm not required to do your... public relations	1

Harry Dawes Did you not once direct Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard?	2, 7
- He had to go back to work	6
Sorry we got here too late to see you dance	3, 6
We certainly are, señorita, because we understand you got a lot of talent	2, 5
And that's the one thing that could make Mr Edwards fly all the way from Rome	2
Maria	8
I would not like to have my mother with me	1
- Because I do not like my mother	3
- I'm sure you don't mean that	6
- If they deserve it We can work all that out later too	2
The point is, the miracle has happened and a great career is yours	5
Nah. He's got all those	8
The trouble with you is you never know where scripts leave off and life begins	3
Ah, Muldoon, you're a charmer	5, 7, 8
Without you, Harry	6

I do not like Mr Kirk Edwards	1
I think that I am pretty enough but I would not want to be that kind of star	6, 7
Now, my five ordinary senses what with alcohol and the rest, are nothing special	5
Therefore, owing to circumstances which believe me, are beyond my control I hereby advise you not to come to Rome to make the test	3
Six months or so ago, I fell in love with one of 'em	5
- She has the name of a man	7
But when the sick one is yourself, you cannot run away	6
When I was a little girl, like so many others there was no money to buy shoes for me.	6
I still need it when I'm afraid	3, 4, 6, 8
You surprise me, Mr Dawes	7
In the dirt, it's hard to tell	2
Then you'll want to say goodbye	6
I am ready, Mr Dawes	2
You've seen it and read it a thousand times	3
Kirk, my dear fellow, I know just what you have in mind	5, 8
He cannot discuss her future availability at this time	2
I was, up to the minute I saw this test	1
- I know the answer	2
Maybe your master knows the answer to that too, or doesn't wanna know	2, 3, 6, 7
We got the room booked for the whole morning	2, 5, 8
It won't take that long	8
But what I tell Maria to do, she will do	1, 8
All right, let's go back to Hollywood and make this movie	2
But you'll never find another Maria	6
If ever a funeral laid an egg, that one did	3
You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body	3, 6
It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her	5, 8
Not my book, anyway	1
The columns and the wolves were after me night and day	4
You could tell it was because they didn't give out interviews about getting married	8
Kirk didn't even look at me	7
Everybody's mother's gotta die sometime	6
Mr Muldoon, it seems that Maria's mother was murdered by Maria's father	7
- Last night	5
As you know, over here crime is not exploited to sell newspapers	1, 5
And we're finished playing the key cities	1
Boss, you think of everything	8
You got a right to open your collar, take off your shoes and relax in Las Vegas for the rest of your life	2
It could make ya cry	1
Montague, if there's one thing I know about, it's Mr John Q Public	5
He wants clean people on the screen for his children to look at	6, 7
Oscar, the phone	1, 2
No, this is Oscar	7
Fine, fine. Say, Harry, something kind of important has come up	6
I say, something kind of important has come up	2
Her father murdered her mother	3, 6, 7
Remember that in the years ahead when you're directing cigarette butts on TV	1
Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need	6, 8
She never slept You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for	2
You could tell just by looking at him that half the time he didn't know where he was	7
And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances the way he kept admitting, over and over, that he killed the old lady	1, 3
Things picked up for the home team when Maria's brother a ganef if ever I saw one, took the stand	2
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times and how, on the night of the murder she not only smashed his radio, but hit him	1, 3, 4, 6
She told about a mother who was full of hate and how she got back the hate she gave	6
You realise maybe the public knows more about public relations than you do	5
Two good and happy years, for me at any rate	5
(I suppose it was the most losing night of Kirk's life) was just about a year ago, in Beverly Hills, California	5
But it soon became obvious that the señor was only mildly interested in the available talent	1, 6
That dated us, all right, but it gave us something to do	2
We were worried about Maria	4
She seemed too restless, too tense, too withdrawn	6
He didn't like it	6, 7
To Oscar, Alberto Bravano was heaven-sent	5, 8
Camps where the men aren't paid enough or protected against disease enough	6, 7
Is it not fortunate, for instance that I own the newspapers in my country?	5
Sore loser. He owes me $187,000 and he won't pay up	1, 3, 7
- I'll say - Double six	7
The last time this witch went to a party she made the princess prick her finger and fall asleep for 100 years	1, 2
- Thank you - Nice party.	5
- And nice questions you ask	2, 5, 8
Yeah	2, 5
Harry? - Shut up	1
Of course I wouldn't	1
A glamour girl, who does not even smoke	3
I should stay where I belong	6
- Probably not	1, 3
I have a coach not pulled by four horses but with the power of 200	5
Did it ever occur to you, Harry that the prince looked everywhere for Cinderella just so that he could put the shoe back on her foot?	1
You cannot rent a prince	7
The fairy tale again	1
A man you can look at in the daytime	5
Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say, Harry	1, 4, 6, 7
I sure pity the people who have to breathe in the daytime	3
Maybe he should carry his own matches - Oh?	7
Oh, you're going to love international café society	5
You're a liar! You repeat yourself	1
- You're a liar	1
This is most evil of all	3, 4, 8
And as for taxes, how many millions have you in tax-exempt bonds and oil wells whose power of production your government protects while it denies such benefits to the brain?	3
Why don't you shut up and go back where you came from	1
So are you. But I admit it openly	1
I will not go back where I came from because I do not like it there	1
- I beg your pardon? - I leave tomorrow morning for Cannes	1
Tell him you're not going, tomorrow morning or ever	6
Don't blow it Just this once, Kirk, why don't you empty your own ashtrays?	1, 3
- You heard what I said?	1, 2
- You said the party's over	1
Tell everybody to go home	1
For four years - and now it's over - for four years I've invited the guests and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests	3, 6
- She'll never make another picture	1, 6
I'll keep her off the screen, I'll destroy her	1
I'll drive you home	8
Even in one of yours I would have thrown this glass at him	1
I'm going home with him instead	5
You want to know the (what do you call it) motivation?	2
I'm a frightened tramp	4
She was wearing them tonight	7
Not even Jerry Some things you just don't tell anybody	1, 3, 4, 6
If it would have helped, I'd have yelled it in the streets	1
The moving finger had already writ and moved on	6
There she was, the world's number one symbol of desirability on display all over the world's number one showroom with the world's number one customers wanting to buy and nobody wrapped her up and took her home	4, 7
I'll swear that into my own grave	3
It's as if ordinary human beings, living ordinary lives had suddenly vanished from the earth and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people	7
They are all happy, all the time	5
She never asks for money but, somehow she always happens to help grateful rich people	3
Hector Eubanks was the fireball of our little cocoon	5, 8
Any more than I could on that night I saw Maria for the last time	6
You write the long word on top of the page and under it, you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one Oh	2, 8
You know something? Off the screen  I don't think I've seen you laugh before	7
You took money from me when I was playing	1
You have cost me millions and millions of francs	1, 3, 6
A dead animal	4, 7
He is less a gigolo than anyone in our immediate company	8
Just as among the kings, I am a clown	7
My champagne is not properly cooled	3
A universal cure	8
But no more odd, surely, than my driving away that day away from her, knowing that inevitably, we would meet again	8
- Maybe you can talk this over in private	4
I do not know what you are, but you are not a woman	3
You cannot love Once, you had the look for me of an exquisite lady	5
You have no way of knowing the way that I think	1
Oh, I think not	1, 7
I left my home simply because I had to leave	6
But I will not attempt one here and now	6, 7
For the first time, when we looked at each other in the Gypsy camp and again at the window of the casino and again, just now, when I held out my hand to you	5, 8
The sword was her husband's	8
My own husband was killed in this last war	6
I admire this gentleman	2, 8
- It has occurred to me	2
It is almost frightening, how much in love with you she is	3, 7
- Then you don't approve	1
That to marry Maria would be the most... cruel and destructive thing you'll ever have done?	1, 4, 7
It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis to get off the world	1, 3
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child	4
"The world will some day see paintings of her, and of her and me and then it will think: ""What a pity they have gone and left nothing behind"""	2, 5
It's a lot of time	6
Especially when it has no days and nights but just days that turn black when the sun goes down	6
Perhaps I have become, as you put it obsessed by our name and our past and the absence of our future, and by our paintings	1, 4, 6
It has happened to me without my wanting almost without my knowing	3
You are quite right, and I do not have the right	6
The bride on whom the rain doth fall	5
Sends her love - You look fine	5, 8
I'm behaving like... like 13 years old	3
As if all my life I had lived in a dark place... and all at once the lights went on	5
No. Never in my life have I been more sure of myself and of everything else	8
- How can I?	6
What would I tell you? That he is handsome and tall, and good and kind, and proud and so on?	3
- And now you will laugh	6, 7
- He kisses my hand	5
- And now you are being deliberately stupid	1, 3
I told you. He is what other men are not	5, 8
- No, I want to hear more about this	2, 7
Looking back, I probably wasn't as worried then as I now think I was	6
I'm giving the bride away	8
- I do not know who plays the violin	2, 4
- And they're having more fun	6
Emotionally, she's a child	1
And she's wrapped all her dreams up in one dream prince, and you're it	2, 4, 7
I don't want her hurt at all	4, 5, 8
- It's not going to be easy	4
I saw her just once more after that wedding night	6
It was fine You've been away all this time?	7
No, I've not been away all that time	6
It's just me I have to.	7
I have known what it is like to be in love	5, 8
And on my wedding night to wait for him, with my heart full of love	2
This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you	5, 6, 8
You find it hard to believe that this is not just a dream you dreamed long time ago	2
Our understanding, without question and without surprise that we were never to be apart again	5, 8
But inevitably there comes a time for waking up even for us	2
You are everything I would want as my wife	5, 8
As for the rest of what I have to say you will find it neatly typed, at some length, on this piece of paper	8
No	1
That's the unholy pity of it	6
You can take him to California	5
Because I needed to tell you	1
That would only make him less unhappy	5
I know Vincenzo better than you do	1
How much simpler it would be, for so many of us if Kirk Edwards had not found it necessary to look for a new face	1
- Suppose he doesn't see it your way	4
- You didn't think I was dead too, did you? - Maria!  (Spanish)	1, 7
Now just a minute.	4
(Oscar) If ever a funeral laid an egg, that one did.	3
- Now that you mention it... - (# guitar music)	7
(Harry) The bride on whom the rain doth fall.	5
(Harry) Looking back, I probably wasn't as worried then as I now think I was.	6
(Harry) I saw her just once more after that wedding night.	6
And on my wedding night to wait for him, with my heart full of love. (music and laughter outside)	2
- He had to go back to work - Through the window?	6
We can work all that out later too	2
He's got all those	8
- Help yourself	1, 3, 5, 8
- My brother took all your cigarettes? - I have another pack	1, 6, 7, 8
You couldn't miss I think that I am pretty enough but I would not want to be that kind of star	6, 7
Like a witch Now, my five ordinary senses what with alcohol and the rest, are nothing special	5
There is absolutely none Kirk, my dear fellow, I know just what you have in mind	5, 8
Now just a minute, gentleman.	4
- Well, I...	1
A great finish You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body	3, 6
Well, it figured. It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her	5, 8
Oscar, shut up Mr Muldoon, it seems that Maria's mother was murdered by Maria's father	7
When?	4, 5, 7
Not yet As you know, over here crime is not exploited to sell newspapers	1, 5
You've made it. You got a right to open your collar, take off your shoes and relax in Las Vegas for the rest of your life	2
What kind of an answer is that against a $10 million world gross?	7
- Thank you	5
- Nice party. - And nice questions you ask	2, 5, 8
Would you mind? Of course I wouldn't	1
Maybe he should carry his own matches	7
- Know what? Oh, you're going to love international café society	5
- How about Bravano?	2, 7
- All but the clincher	5
- Goliath versus Goliath	7
- You're a liar. You're a liar!	1
But it is only yours I attack	1, 3
So are you.	1
But I admit it openly	5
- Maria! Tell him you're not going, tomorrow morning or ever	6
Oscar	2
I've warned you about getting too drunk For four years - and now it's over - for four years I've invited the guests and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests	3, 6
to the Supreme Court I'll keep her off the screen, I'll destroy her	1
Not even Jerry	1, 3, 4, 6
Some things you just don't tell anybody If it would have helped, I'd have yelled it in the streets	1
But then, who could? There she was, the world's number one symbol of desirability on display all over the world's number one showroom with the world's number one customers wanting to buy and nobody wrapped her up and took her home	4, 7
You write the long word on top of the page and under it, you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one	2, 8
You know something? Off the screen	7
Every night's like every other night	3
I only see that you have the body of an animal A dead animal	4, 7
No. I left my home simply because I had to leave	6
Who's the contessa's cousin this week?	7
He's a tortured, neurotic man, who's finishing life on his own terms	1
As an ensign in the United States Navy, you go down to the sea to fight in the toughest conflict of all time.	8
- Congratulations, willie.	8
- I'm sorry, willie.	3, 6
we can go to the Fairmont ...	6
- willie, don't.	1
If there were more time ...	6
watch that enthusiasm. This is the Caine.	1
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hours a day to Keep her together.	5, 6, 8
I'm very fond of my wife and Kid.	5
- I didn't Know anything about this.	6, 7
- It's incredible stupidity ...	1, 6, 7
- Is it unf air?	1
- what is it, Meatball?	4
what do you Know?	2
Now that I've shot my f ace off, I'll give you the chance to do the same.	1, 2, 5
- Captain ...	4
willie, you look worried.	4, 6
look what just came in.	7
I'm always delighted to meet willie's friends.	5
- Miss wynn is going with you?	7
- like a new song.	2, 5
Let the fire f all!	5
Sometimes I thinK there's almost a chance for us.	5
- willie, it's getting late.	1
would you spend the rest of your life with me?	5, 8
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help ... constructive loyalty.	8
- Don't be so sentimental, willie.	1
we could have backed him up.	6
You Knew nothing about DeVriess and you Know even less about Queeg.	1, 3, 8
I Know about abnormal behaviour.	6
The rolling balls, the second-hand phrases, the migraine headaches ... Shirt-tails, and tonight's speech:  I turned yellow but my dog likes me.	6
- I thinK Tom does make sense.	8
will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said?	4, 8
- It can only blow up in our f aces.	4
Some of you thinK you can outsmart me.	1, 8
Jorgensen ...?	7
- Unsatisf actory.	1, 3
Steve, are you f amiliar with Article 184 of Navy regulations?	4
- He swallowed his Key.	3
- Good lucK, Harding.	8
- thank you, sir.	8
I Kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble.	6
- what are you driving at?	1
- why didn't you tell me before?	1
- without Tom, I'll get nowhere.	8
- I don't Know what Tom is ... now.	4
- No. - I suggest that we do.	2
we can't Keep riding with our stern to the wind.	6, 7
- back the starboard engine!	7
If we Keep our stern to the wind, we'll roll over.	4
we'll head into the wind.	2
If you officers Know what's good for you, tell them to stop.	1, 3
willie, I'm worried.	4
- I'm a friend of the f amily.	8
- Three ships were lost, you Know.	6
Myself. when I am in possession of my f aculties and Queeg is not.	1, 4
MaryK showed me a log he had written on Queeg's behaviour.	7
On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action, and that we'd be charged with mutiny.	1, 3
Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement, would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him?	2
- what Kind of personality?	2
My unreliable helmsman f ailed to warn me about that.	1, 6
weren't you reprimanding a seaman for having his shirt-tail out, while the ship turned 360 degrees?	1, 3
we assume that no commander of a US naval ship can possibly be a coward.	8
The shakespeare whose testimony nearly sunk us all.	3
I'm drunker than you are, so it'll be a f air fight.	1
- thanks, Dad.	5
- would you repeat it in court?	8
As an ensign in the United States Navy, - you go down to the sea to fight in the toughest conflict of all time.	8
There's a time for everything.	8
we can go to the Fairmont...	6
Meaning what?	1
willie, don't.	1
I'll try to be worthy of the job.	2, 5
That does it.	1
The tour was very interesting.	5
Here we go again.	4
I didn't Know anything about this.	6, 7
He shouldn't have to decide here.	6
Your opinion might be valuable.	8
Did you decode the message?	2
It's incredible stupidity...	1, 6, 7
Is it unf air?	1
Go ahead, man to man.	1, 2
Request permission to leave. - Captain, sir?	2, 4
what is it, Meatball?	4
It's against Navy regulations.	1
Captain...	4
But it's happening.	2
Let the fire f all.	5
willie, it's getting late.	1
There must be a reason for this.	8
thanks, Dad.	5
Old Yellowstain will be flattered.	2
Let him.	1, 2
I thinK Tom does make sense.	8
It can only blow up in our f aces.	4
Stop putting on that gear.	1, 7
Lay off.	1
I'm not blind.	1
Painter?	7
Unsatisf actory.	1, 3
Good lucK, Harding.	8
The Caine's a floating mistake.	8
They'll never believe us.	1, 4, 6
Is this record correct or not?	1
why didn't you tell me before?	1
Steve, what do we do now?	2
- I don't Know what Tom is... now.	4
- No. I suggest that we do.	2
back the starboard engine.	7
Captain, back the starboard engine.	4
I'll always regret that I didn't.	6
Are you our lawyer?	2
I'm a friend of the f amily.	8
would you repeat it in court?	8
Did you like Captain Queeg?	2
He acted strange.	7
On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action, - and that we'd be charged with mutiny.	1, 3
He's lying.	1, 8
How did it go, Tom?	2, 5
I never mentioned any illness.	7
what Kind of personality?	2
That's absurdly hypothetical.	6, 7
Absolutely.	5, 7
I wanted to save the ship.	6
No more questions.	1
weren't you reprimanding a seaman for having his shirt-tail out, - while the ship turned 360 degrees?	1, 3
The question is abusive.	3
If that's true, we were guilty.	2, 4, 6
Let's forget it.	1, 8
I don't want any more of it. Not another minute.	1, 2, 3
And so today you are full-fledged ensigns.	2, 5, 8
From here on... your education must continue in the more demanding school of actual war.	1, 3
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign in the United States Navy... you go down to the sea to fight... in the toughest conflict of all time.	8
-Congratulations. -Thank you, Uncle Lloyd.	8
I'm afraid I'll have to skip your party tonight.	3, 6
Some of the fellows are having a celebration--	5
I wanted you to meet her, but there's a time for everything.	8
I didn't mean to ruin your big evening.	6
We can go to the Fairmont, Top Of The Mark--anything you say.	6
-Meaning what?	1
-I've only got 48 hours.	4
Willie, don't.	1
-If there were more time-- -Don't look so embarrassed.	6
I guess I forgot how I was. -Just another nightclub singer... for a big weekend.	7
That ship you're assigned to has been in lots of battles. -Don't worry.	8
-Take this extra $100, dear.	8
Promise me to be careful.	8
I promise. Good-bye, sweetheart.	5, 8
Watch that enthusiasm. Nobody's left that way about the Caine before.	1
-Your orders.	8
Those monstrous papers that transform ex-civilians into men without minds.	1
Well, I only hope that you're good enough for the Caine.	2
I'll try to be worthy of this assignment.	2, 5
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hours a day to keep her in once piece. -I understand.	5, 6, 8
Well, that about does it.	1
I have a wife and a kid. I'm very fond of them.	5
I regret to tell you I'm gonna be sick. I'm sorry.	3, 6
-That's darn cordial of you. -Perfectly welcome.	5, 7
It's all right.	5, 8
I didn't know anything about this.	6, 7
This is hardly the place for a decision. Nonsense.	6
Ah, Willie. You will live to regret this day.	1, 3
ff the war lasts 10 years, you may learn the difference... between aircraft and sea gulls.	1, 3
Go dry yourself.	1
A Princeton man's opinion might he valuable. Thanks.	8
It's still in the pocket of my dirty khakis.	3, 6
Did you decode the message? No, sir.	2
-Anyone can make a mistake.	8
The margin for error is narrow in the navy.	8
There's too much loss of life and property possible in every act.	3, 6
Do you consider it unfair?	1
Go ahead. Man-to-man.	1, 2
-Feel better?	6
We all have our own ways of running a ship. Sure.  This one's tired.	8
Ought to be melted down for razor blades.	1, 3
-Request permission to leave the ship. -Permission granted.  -Captain, sir?	2, 4
-What is it, Meatball? Nothing.	4
I won't accept it. It's against navy regulations.	1
Well, what do you know.	2
Now to get down to cases.	2
Now that I've shot my face off, any one can now do the same thing.	1, 2, 5
The right way, the wrong way, the navy way and my way.	8
-Captain.	4
But it's happened!	2
-You said keep right standard rudder.	1
-We've cut the target adrift. We did nothing of the kind.	2
-Aye, aye, sir. All engines ahead full.	2
-Sir? -You look worried.	4, 6
Our captain is about to be boiled in oil.	1, 3, 4
It's wonderful to have my boy close again.	7
I'm always delighted to meet one of Wiflie's friends.	5
Sure. I'll he right down then.	8
Miss Wynn is going with you?	7
I like her a tot.	2, 5, 8
-I promise. -You mean it?	4, 8
Good-bye, Mom.	6
-Like breaking in a new song--	2, 5
It's fun, but it scares me.	4, 5
It was nice of your mother to let you go to Yosemite.	5
-It wasn't up to my mother.	1, 6
-This is paradise. -Isn't it?	5
It's getting late. It's getting very late.	1
What would you think of spending your life with a monster tike me?	5, 8
Don't look at me as if I were crazy.	3
But you'll marry me anyway. And you'll be so unhappy that--	1, 3
I made it clear I inherited a ship in a low state of training... and couldn't he expected to pull it into shape overnight. He agreed.	1
From now on, there will not he any further mistakes... on the part of the officers and orew of this ship.	3, 6
The navy's waiting for a butoh. Well, I'm not going to make it.  And I'm not gonna permit anybody to make it for me.	2, 4
Gentlemen, I've good news for you.	2, 5
The greatest. Let's all straighten up and fly right!	8
-Don't look for trouble.	1
-Thanks, Dad. -You're welcome.	5
Thought you'd be amused.	2, 7
This is a saga of a man whose tack of charm... is exceeded only by his lack of intestinal fortitude.	3
Find somebody else to sing about. That's an order!	1
Why? Old Yellowstain ought to be flattered.	2
I'm not feeling too well. What I have to say won't take long.	6
As I always say, a command is a lonely job. It isn't easy to make decisions.	6
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help--by help I mean... oonstructive loyalty.	8
We all have our ideas of right and wrong... but we have to pitch in for the good of the family.	2, 4, 8
If there's anything any of you would like to say... I'll be glad to listen.	8
Have the pharmacist send some more aspirin. My headache's much worse.	6
Don't be so sentimental.	1
I thought it was a pretty good speech.	5, 6
We could've backed him up.	6
Look, Princeton, you knew nothing about DeVriess; you know less about Queeg.	1, 3, 8
-I'm no psychiatrist... but I know something about abnormal behavior.	6
It's just a question of time before he goes over the line.	4
His fixation on the little rolling balls. The chattering in secondhand phrases and slogans.  His inability to look you in the eye, his migraine headaches.	6
I think Tom makes sense.	8
You stay out of this. All right.	1
So he has migraine headaches... and he rolls steel balls and does other screwy things. So what?	1, 3
Everybody's a screwball in some way. That doesn't make them crazy.	2, 3, 5, 6, 8
Will you go over to the medical officer with me... and repeat everything you've told me?	4, 8
-Well, then. Why should you expect me to take this on my shoulders?	4, 6, 7
There'll be no more talk ahout the captain being crazy.	1, 3
Like running around explosives with a blowtorch.	4
I still insist he's a paranoia case.	3
-I just assumed-- -You assumed?  This was calculated disrespect to your commanding officer.	3
This afternoon the captain held a general drill... for the instruction and safety of the crew.	2, 8
Many men have ignored my orders about wearing battle gear. So there's only one way to drive the point home.	6, 7
Stop putting on that gear! Mr. Keith.	1, 7
Some sailors still think they can pull a fast one on me.	1, 8
No liberty for any crew member for three months!	1, 4
I will not be made a fool of! Do you hear me?	1
How's it going? Situation quiet.	5
-I'm not blind! I've watched the man--	1
I suppose you're wondering why I called this meeting.	2
-Two, sir.	8
-Paynter? -Two, sir.	7
-Two, sir. -Jorgenson?	7
This tureen holds an amount of sand equal to the strawberries we had. -Right, Whittaker?	3, 6
You mean in the morning?	7
Now does not mean in the morning. It means 0147.	1, 3
-Unsatisfactory.	1, 3
Everybody was willing to forget about it. But not me.	1, 3
I never thought of that.	7
Get on the ball. We'll have a little fun, now that we've detective work to do.  Yes, sir.	2, 5, 8
Turn me in if you want to, but this is it. This is over the line.	1
Are you familiar with Article 184 of navy regulations?	4
He swallowed the key with his coffee. Very tricky!	3
-Good luck. Thank you, sir.	8
I know. The mess boys ate the strawberries.	1
I didn't want to get them into trouble. Then I made my mistake.	6
Boy, am I happy to get out of this madhouse. So long, and good luck.	5
The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.	8
-What are you driving at?	1
-They'll never believe our story.	1, 4, 6
-Is this record correct or not? -Yes, it's correct.	1
Everything you've got in your log oan be interpreted as an attempt at discipline.	1, 3
-Halsey hasn't.	1, 5
Just he glad I thought of it now. If we go through with this, we're in trouble.	4
-I'm willing to take a chance.	2, 5
I see six sides to every risk and 12 reasons not to take it. Cut the kidding.	4
Behind this brilliant, eloquent exterior, I've got a wide yellow streak.	6
Without Tom, I couldn't get to first base.	8
To tell you the truth, I don't know what Tom is now.	4
You'd better double-time back to your ship.	2, 4
-I suggest that we do.	2
It's difficult holding her, sir! The wheel feels loose.	4
I don't know if we can keep riding with our stern to the wind!	6, 7
-I told Mr. Keefer-- -Speak when you're spoken to!	8
Back-to starboard engine!	4, 7
If we keep running with our stern to the wind, we'll roll over!	4
We've received no orders to maneuver. Fleet course is 1-8-0.	1, 3
Heading 2-4-5! I can't hold the wheel!	6
We'll do much better heading into the wind.	2
Fleet course is 1-8-0! Captain, we're in serious trouble!	4
If you question my decisions again, I'll order you off this bridge.	1, 3
You're the officer of the deck.	1
Officers, if you know what's good for you, tell them to stop while they can!	1, 3
An officer from your ship called.	1, 7
I'm worried.	4
I'll regret that I didn't for the rest of my life. Please.	6
-Are you our lawyer?	2
-I'm a friend of the family.	8
That's pretty flip under the circumstances.	5
I don't want to upset you, but you have an excellent chance of being hanged.	7
All right.	2, 3
-Three ships were lost in the typhoon.	6
The navy has three psychiatrists prepared to say Oueeg is sane. Sure.	8
It's my business to be a judge of human behavior.	1, 2
Are you ready to repeat it on the witness stand?	8
That's confusing the issue. I'm not on trial.	7
Well, I guess I can't blame you.	6
-Then how do I plead?	4
Myself, sir... when I'm in possession of my faculties and Commander Queeg is not.	1, 4
It's contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.	1, 3
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon? -No, sir.	1, 2
I was da-- I was plenty scared.	4
-Did you like Captain Queeg? -I liked him.	2
Not a tot, but I liked him.	5, 8
Did Captain Queeg show any external signs of being sick?	4, 7
Yes. Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log he'd written on Queeg's behavior.	7
When we arrived, I told him as forcibly as I could... that the log didn't justify such action... and that we'd all be liable to a charge of mutiny.	1, 3
-He's lying!	1, 8
Every time he opens his mouth he gets you into more trouble.	1, 4
-How'd it go?	2, 5
May I ask you, as a psychiatrist... is it possible for a sane man to perform offensive or foolish acts?	6
Assuming the captain's conduct was harsh and often showed bad judgement... would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him?	2
You still say the defendant was unjustified in relieving him?	7
My background is legal, not medical. Forgive me if I ask elementary questions.  That's all right.	6
Lieutenant Maryk is.	1
Inclined to hound subordinates about small details? Yes.	1, 2
That's part of the picture, yes.	8
I never said there was illness!	7
What kind of personality?	2
If I may speak. I'd tike to protest the council's twisting of words.	1, 3
That's absurdly hypothetical. Is it?	6, 7
Council for defense has raised an interesting point.	7
Ahsolutely.	5
-He's sure gonna hear down on me.	1
And honestly, if I had to do it again, I'd do it.	8
None.	1
I can't.	1, 4, 6, 7
Isn't the reverse possible?	2, 4
No further questions.	3
I bear them no malice. I'm extremely sorry for them.	6
My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me we were coming around 360 degrees.	1, 6
Weren't you engaged in reprimanding a seaman named Dlugatch, at length... for caving his shirttail out, while the ship turned 360 degrees?	1, 3
I reprimanded him, but that only took two seconds.	7
The question is abusive and flagrantly leading.	3
The defense assumes no man who rises to command a naval ship can he a coward.	8
Now, I didn't say that!	1
I don't believe the court can hear you.	4
-I request a recess to give him--	7
Have you no recollection of a conversation with Ensign Harding... just prior to his leaving the Caine? -What ahout it?	2
-Didn't he tell you they ate them?	2, 7
There's no need for that! He'll just tell you lies!	1
They were all disloyal!	1, 3, 6, 7
Steve, make 'em pipe down, will you?	1
-Hello, Rabbit. How are you?  Hello, Jim.	5, 8
No matter what, he endangered the ship and the lives of the men.	4
It wouldn't have helped our case any.	6
You didn't approve of his conduct. He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.	3, 6
You're an honest man, Steve.	2
If that's true, then we were guilty.	2, 4, 6
The Caine's favorite author. The Shakespeare who's testimony nearly sunk us all.	3
He never even heard of Captain Queeg!	7
Forget it. Queeg was sick.	1, 8
I'm a lot drunker than you are, so it'll be a fair fight.	1
Well, I don't want anymore of it. -Not another minute!	1, 2, 3
-Yes, sir.	2
Steve. Thought you'd be amused.	2, 7
Just he glad I thought of it now.	1
If we go through with this, we're in trouble.	4
what do you know?	2
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help ... constructive Ioyalty.	8
- I don't know what Tom is ... now.	4
we can't keep riding with our stern to the wind.	6, 7
Myself. when I am in possession of my faculties and Queeg is not.	1, 4
- what kind of personality?	2
We`d have got married and had a house and children.	6
There`s a train belonging to my government standing in Yuriatin. It has a carriage for myself and my assistants.	8
There`s no question.	1
Strelnikov is dead.	7
Do you see how this affects Larissa?	1
You don`t.	1, 3
Throughout the entire interview, he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov which is his right name, and refused to answer to the name of Strelnikov.	3
Oh, my God! Don`t tell Lara this.	4
Now, I know exactly what you think of me.	3

Comrade, there`s got to be room. lt`s all right, I have to bring our sledge.	2, 5
Hurry.	1
You fool!	1, 2, 7
He`ll never leave Russia. Let him stay.	1
He suffered me to buy him a new suit. And to get him a job at his old hospital.	7
So, he never saw her again?	6
The walls of his heart were like paper. But, he kept it to himself.  He kept a lot to himself.	1, 6
She`d come to Moscow to look for her child. I helped her as far as I could.	5
-We? -My father.  -Not your father, Komarovsky.	1
Will you think about it?	8
lt`s all right, David.	5, 6, 8
You`ve promised to think about it.	1, 6
Can you play the balalaika?	2
An artist? Who taught you?	8
My government has a train, standing in Yuryatin. There's a carriage for myself and my assistants.	8
No question. I'm not going with you.	1

It's all right. I'll bring our sledge.  KOMAROVSKY:	2, 5
- He'll never leave Russia. Let him stay.  You've come with me, haven't you?	1
He suffered me to buy him a new suit and to get him a job at his old hospital.	7
YEVGRAF: I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.	2, 4, 5, 7
"Throughout the entire interview he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov and refused to answer to ""Strelnikov. """	3
How many? All of us.  Sorry, not enough room.	4, 7
It's all right. I'll bring our sledge.  Hurry.	2, 5

- How many? - All of us.	4, 7
Comrade, there's got to be room. It's all right, I have to bring our sledge.	2, 5

Well... I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.	3, 6, 7
Where's the admiral?	1
- Let me see those dispatches.	2
- Right, sir. Except we're not behind schedule, we're ahead of it.	5
The Japs moved out last night.	7
- When did you learn this?	7
What did he mean by that?	2, 7
This one's tougher.	2
- Thanks, Boats. - We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.	2, 5, 7, 8
- They flew me from Pearl. I've been waiting 10 days for that slow boat of yours to come in!	1
Torrey asked for me, Bev. - Not right away!  That wouldn't be fair.	4
- I see. - I'll tell Eddington I'm engaged to Jere.	2
Instinct. He's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm.	7
With Sabrina?	2, 5
Well... I can't start acting like a father now.	4, 6
Paul, let me go!	1
"Good old ""Swayback""."	8
- She is a real lady. It's a nice sentimental gesture, CinCPac sending your old cruiser.	2, 5, 8
- 5,000? !  - At that rate, we only have three weeks.	4
- Goodnight, girls. See you tomorrow.	2, 8
A doctor.	1, 4, 7
- Sir?	2
- Find him.	2
- Something wrong? - Just find him.	3
Thanks, Rock. But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy.	7
You'll stump to Tokýo with the rest of us.	1
- l love you.	5, 8
"- l just said, ""l love you."""	1
- l got a run of three.	5
- 1 2 bat-blind ships.	7
At this rate, we'll have to head home inside 1 0 hours.	2, 3
Eddington said to tell the old man - l'm sorry, sir, the captain - that he'd better start thinking about a tow.	4
- Two rings...purse.	7
- How do you do? - You don't mind?	5
- l hope so.	4
- ls it important?	2
- Brandy for me. - Miss Dorne?	5
- l was just an ensign.	6
- l don't think so.	1
- Think I'm an idiot? - What?	1, 7
From any of those islands, he could launch a strike against... - ...  Levu-Vana.	4
- l'd like to see Nurse Lt. Maggie Haynes.	2
is this the admiral's harem?	3
There's no way to make this easy, Mrs McConnel.	4
- So, congratulations, Admiral Torrey. - Thank you, sir.	5, 8
- Yes, sir. - ln charge of piers and warehouses?	7
- l'd have to lead them through.	7
One thing... Admiral Broderick only allowed us 1 0 planes...	4
- Forget it. Now...	3, 5, 8
The rest can go home. - May I ask what you're planning?	4
- lt wasn't worth it.	1
I've been waiting 1 0 days for that slow boat of yours to come in!	1
- l'll tell Eddington I'm engaged to Jere.	2
It's a nice sentimental gesture, cincpac sending your old cruiser.	2, 5, 8
- 5,000? - At that rate, we only have three weeks.	4
- l bet that was fun.	2, 3, 5, 8
- l might not get you back this time.	6
Repeat, 1 2 destroyers.	4
There's no way to make this easy, Mrs. McConnel.	4
- Yes, sir. - In charge of piers and warehouses?	7
One thing... Admiral Broderick only allowed us ten planes...	4
- Mr. Canfil, you've fallen in with thieves.	1, 3
I've been waiting ten days for that slow boat of yours to come in!	1
"I""m gonna put a stop to this."	1, 2
- I Iove you. - What?	5
"- I just said, ""I Iove you."""	1
"- Yes, ma""am?"	2, 8
"I""m awake, Leary."	5
- well, then, bacon and eggs for me.	2
"In case it slipped your mind, it""s gunnery stations at 0830."	3
"I""m obsoIescing like this old straw-bottomed cruiser of ours."	6
"I""II put in for a transfer."	2
"I""m sorry, Rock."	6
splendid, thank you, sir.	5
"Why aren""t they over Diamond Head?"	7
"I don""t like it, paul."	3
Man Your battle stations!	2
"If they does, I""II guarantee they""II never see nothin"" again!"	1, 2, 8
- 1 2 bat-bIind ships.	7
- Thank you, admiral Broderick.	5
"She""s empty."	7
"At this rate, we""II have to head home inside 1 0 hours."	2, 3
"- That""d be an invitation to enemy subs."	2
"We haven""t enough fuel to hold the keel down."	4
"- What""s wrong?"	7
"Eddington said to tell the old man - I""m sorry, sir, the captain - that he""d better start thinking about a tow."	4
- Can do, sir. Can you pass some portable pumps to us?	2
my group was expendable. I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that.	6, 7
"Soon they""II make admiraIs out of captains with guts."	1
- Sign here. He was my only boy, and I Iove him so much.	5, 6, 8
- He was my only boy.	1
- Bourbon.	6
"- Sorry, nothin"" but beer."	4
Yes, sir.	2
A 3-month-oId fracture, some infection.	2, 8
"That""s a real nice sound to wake up to."	5
"- Not what it says in here. Her secret is that she""s making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances."	1, 3, 6
well, anyway... I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them.	1, 3
Two hands, congratulations.	2, 5
- How?	2
"There""s some action at a place in MoanaIua."	1, 6
"No, no parties for me. Anyway, when do you special intelligence officers do what you""re supposed to do?"	1
- Come on, Rock...	1
- Gaby, this is Egan.	5
"- What""s funny? Not exactly funny, it""s just that you""re so different from your son."	7
- will it be all right?	4
- Thank you for not recognising me. I made a special effort to not look like a nurse.	2, 7
"I""m sure he""s all he should be. I""m flying under false colours, Miss Haynes."	3, 6
"I""m Maggie..."	8
"But don""t wait too long."	6
- Is she well?	8
"I expect you""ve heard of NeaI OWynn."	1
- Routing convoys. I expect to be in the forward areas, if not actually in combat.	2
"What""s good for him is good for the Navy."	2
- Where did you get that?	2
"That""s top secret."	4, 8
"- That""s OWynn he""s sitting with."	2, 5
well... !	2
"I""d like to meet him, Rock."	7
It gets late fast in these times.	2, 5
"Thanks, but I""m waiting for a friend. You""re more than welcome to bring her, or him, along."	5
"- I hope you""II accept."	5, 7
"Here""s how."	2
You married his aide?	3
"- He wasn""t much of a man."	6
Not very smart or very brave.	7
"Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn""t."	4
That is useful.	2
"She was beautiful. I don""t know why she married me."	6
- I bet you were something as an ensign!	6
You left out one small detail.	5, 6, 8
"You""re a good cook, Maggie."	5
- would you Iike to dance?	1
"- What""s the matter? We""d better go home."	4
"I""m sorry, Jere, but I want to go."	1, 7
"- Isn""t that what you""ve been doing?"	1, 4, 6, 8
- A Iot of tonnage. - Hard to come by.	2, 8
So Broderick could hit LaIatea, Muk or Gavabutu. From any of those islands, he could launch a strike against...	4
"pleasant surprise. You""re not easy to talk to on the phone, so I decided to ambush you."	2
"You know I can""t say."	1
"Do you think we""d better let it go at that?"	3
Maggie?	5
Eddington. TouIebonne Base.	2
paul Eddington.	1, 3, 8
welcome, Maggie Haynes.	5
- Are you also going to Gavabutu? - No!	1, 4
"The Navy can""t do without me here, the island might sink!"	7
"You don""t like what you""re doing?"	3, 6
"He won""t believe it, but tell him anyway."	4, 6
How are you?	2, 4
"I came to tell you that your husband is missing in action. You won""t get the official telegram for a day or two."	2
but if admiral Broderick knows anything, III eat my hat.	4
"I""m surprised that Mac would put that in a letter."	6
"I don""t intend to..."	1
"- You""II just have time to change."	2, 6
"Take me home. gentlemen, we""II get to the business of the evening."	2
- powell, you can do the honours. - Thank you, sir.	2
gentlemen, to admiral RockweII Torrey.	2, 5
"- gentlemen, I""II see y""all later."	1
"We gave him the molasses, now let""s feed him the sulphur."	4, 7, 8
"You""re going to mop up Gavabutu and mount the invasion of Levu-Vana."	2
"He""s bad for our allies, a comfort to the enemy."	8
Just get the job done. How far can I go with admiral Broderick?	6
I Iike to think they brought me luck.	1
I sent for you two hours ago.	7
"Didn""t you see the directive that all personnel be cIean-shaven?"	7
"OK, you""re it. You""II be my liaison officer, we""II call it."	7
"Don""t crawfish, it was your idea."	4
Let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey. - colonel Gregory, Paramarines.  - pleasure, sir.	2
Maybe a little rusty, sir, but eager as hell.	2
At ease.	1, 2
- Mr GottIieb.	2, 8
- Very well, thank you, sir. Commander NeaI OWynn, sir.	2, 5
"while on my staff, you""II communicate with TouIebonne through me."	8
"There""II be a slight delay."	2
could a battalion cross those peaks at night?	5
"If they didn""t have to lug cannons with them."	2
Just a minute. Cdr.	4
"- TouIebonne sends a spare till it""s fixed."	6
"- I think so, too, I""m happy to say."	1, 3
"- Let""s say a sightseeing trip. You got a pencil?"	4
You may return to your duties.	2
OWynn.	6
"I cannot accept you as Rock Torrey""s son. - I think somebody got in ahead of him."	3, 6, 7
- That it does.	5
- No. - I think you are.  - Now, wait a...	2, 7
- I am doing it.	1
"As far as I""m concerned, a coconut hit you on the mouth."	1, 3
"You""d better figure out an excuse to get us on that plane."	7
"One word from me to Broderick and you""re on your way."	2
- Levu-Vana.	2
We voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with. - Thanks, Boats.	3
Goodbye, CuIpepper... Goodbye, AI.	2, 5, 7, 8
Wait, have you already been given an assignment...?	5, 7
"- Not right away. We""ve got 30 days survivors"" leave."	4
OK.	2
"He""s Torrey""s best friend. Instinct."	1, 3, 6
"- What? - I don""t know."	7
Out here all alone with me.	2, 7, 8
"- They don""t want to."	2
- A CunIiffe marry a commoner?	5, 8
- Put them down and turn your back. - Not this time, baby.	1
"I might as well be in a Mother Hubbard. - You""re beautiful.  - My clothes, please."	1
"There""s this boy..."	2, 5
- She looks like a real lady.	8
"- A battleship might be more comforting. - I""m glad to see her."	2, 8
This is what it boils down to.	2
Nips are as thick as treacle pudding on that island.	1, 7
Not soon.	2
"It""d take a sub 1 0 days to get there."	3
Get a message off to pearl.	2
Make it strong.	8
- darling, is that you? - Hi, honey.	2
"They don""t tell you why."	4
"Something""s going to happen on Gavabutu soon. Oh, hell!"	2, 4
"I""m gonna cry anyway!"	1, 3, 4, 7
- Carry on.	2
I know what you mean, sir.	7
- Goodbye, Jere. - Goodbye.	6
"We""re due for five days of sunshine. Good-oh!"	2
- hello, Mac.	2
"I""II be right over. Mac."	2
Rover, this is John Paul. Come in.	2
"Transmission""s weak. Rover, this is John paul."	4
Keep sending, over.	4, 6
"He""s getting farther away."	6
"We""ve got you, clear."	8
"I""ve got something down here."	2, 5
Repeat, 1 2 destroyers. Four cruisers...	4
"They can""t go very fast."	2
"Maybe, but paul wasn""t hunting medals."	6
"What""s it like...?"	2, 7
"I""m so scared my bones are clicking, like dice on a Reno crap table."	4
I should be back in hollywood, sitting in front of a typewriter, making all this up for a movie.	7
roll one!	5
"We got ""em!"	2, 5, 7
"We got ""em again!"	1
"- That""s cutting ""em down to size!"	1
- casualty report?	6
"You""re wanted in plot."	2, 7
"She""s getting outta range!"	7
AII guns to fire at the turn.	2, 4
"They""re all dead."	6
"I""m taking over the bridge."	2, 5
"But you""re going to be all right."	5, 8
"We were licked, weren""t we?"	3, 7
"- You""re a hard man to kill, admiral."	1
"You""II stump to Tokyo with the rest of us."	1
"You""II do it from the deck of a ship in command of a task force."	8
-That's all?	7
-You got it.	8
How come we never met before?	7
-Yes. I'd never have guessed.	6
-Am I, Max? -No.	3, 6, 7
-l gotta impress the British.	2
"When we say not bad, we don't mean ""not bad."" -We mean it's bloody marvelous.  -Yeah?"	7
-Did he ever show you the ring?	5
-l'm warning you.	1
-What is it?	2, 7
-You asked for second helpings.	1
-Keep your mouth shut!	1
You British insult easy. Catch one of these cruds passing up a buck.	1
-You should!	2
-There's a wireless in this hut, sir.	7
-Hello, Stevie.	5
-Not the way I'd choose for suicide.	6
-Why do you say that?	7
-He'd been caught stealing rations. -l see.	7
-l got a better idea.	2, 5, 8
-l'll get you another one. Catch it.	8
-Leave it to me. I'll tell you.	8
-lf it wouldn't be too much trouble.	4, 8
-Pleased to meet you.	2, 5, 8
Now, today....	2
-Do you know anything about them?	2
-lt's the right mate too. -How do you know?  -l looked.	2
-Where are you taking it? -To the hospital.	6, 7
-How'd we do?	2
Well, I don't think I can do much, sir, but....	6, 7
-He's gone to 2100.	5
Listen, take it, $ 108. Ten percent.	5
You worked for it. lt's yours.	5, 8
-Yeah, Col. Brant.	2
-What beast are you talking about?	2
He's mad. lt was an accident.	1, 4, 6, 7
-You can't order me to do that.	1
I'm going to kill it.	1, 2, 3
is it real? is it real pig?	7
-May I? May I?	2, 5
-Mother of God. Hawkins' dog?  -You said pig.	1, 7
Dog, pig, what's the big difference? Meat's meat.	5, 8
It isn't that. lt's what Pete said.	6, 7
-Yes. Take care now.	2, 8
-Don't bother.	1
-Sorry, sir. Careless.	3, 6
-What do you know about this?	1
-l don't believe you. -You can't accuse me, sir.	1, 4
-l don't know anything about it.	4
-lt couldn't have been me, sir.	4
Yes, but that doesn't--	6, 7
One day, you´re going to make a slip. All this wealth you´ve got won´t check against my list.	2
I´m not playing at being provost marshal. And I never heard of luck that didn´t run out.	1, 6
Yours will, depend on it. Because you´re like all criminals, you´re greedy.	3
But you make one slip, just one and we´ll see how long you survive in my cage.	1, 2
-That´s all?	7
Save the jokes.	1, 2
-Did it?	6
I was gonna fix some chow.	2
Who are they? It doesn´t matter.	2, 5
-lt better be.	2
How about that?	7
"Don´t get excited, Fortnum. When we say not bad, we don´t mean ""not bad.""  -We mean it´s bloody marvelous."	7
What do you mean when you say it´s bloody marvelous? Bit dicey.	1, 3
We stuff those.	1, 2
Just recovering from the pleasure of seeing you twice today. Col. Sellars has reported the theft of a gold ring.	1
That Col. Sellars. Yes.  Yes.	7
Just answer the questions.	5
-No, he never even discussed marriage.	1
-You´re lying, Marlowe!	3
Threw in the Ronson.	2
-lt´s what I said. Shove your money.	1, 3
You treated him right.	1, 3
-Nothing. I just been to the park.	5
Not only in Java.	1, 3
And why do we collect them? It´s pure protein.	3
-l really ate them, did I?	1
Right.	1
Townsend? Well?  I´m waiting.	1
-l never touched a grain. I swear.	1, 7
You don´t exist.	1
Would you say thank you to her?	7
It´s okay. I got a lousy temper and an awful accent. I sound toffee-nosed. You British insult easy.	1
There is a radio. A radio is against the orders of the Imperial Army.	4
If there´s one here, it´s your responsibility.	2
There´s no radio or wireless, as you call it, in this hut that I know of.	1
-Do you hear me?	7
-lt´s your job to enforce the law.	1, 3
I shall report your impertinence to Gen. Shima. Yes, please do.  Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch 20 flies a day.	1, 2, 3
He´s lucky.	8
Medically, it ought to be very valuable. I´m just lucky, sir.	1, 3
Do I give him quinine? -Of course give him quinine.  -Well, I´m sorry.	1
I´ll see them before I go off.	5
Have they identified the body?	6
Unusual name.	7
-Unless, of course, he was put there. -Oh?  -Why do you say that?	7
-Well, they held a court of inquiry. -He´d been caught stealing rations.	1, 3, 5
Will you knock it off? !	2, 5, 8
Come on, will you? That´s it.  You and Max trap it.	8
Gather around and hear the words of the King.	1
And the whole court strained in obedience. Come on, come on, come on.	3
-Come on. Food.  Right?	2, 4, 7, 8
-What´s that got to do with rats?	8
-Eat it? -Eat what?  What´s he talking about?	1
There are no rabbits in Malaya.	2, 4
Now, how we gonna sex it?	8
Who´s Vexley?	4, 8
Hello, Peter.	2
I beg your pardon?	2
-Cigarette, sir?	8
Why thank you, corporal.	6, 8
-Holy cow! -Know what that means?	3
I got another one.	2
Don´t forget, you and your crook friend are on my list.	1, 2
I don´t know what you´re talking about. I haven´t broken orders.	3
If you sell your soul, you´ve got to pay sometime. Don´t give me all that sally army stuff.	1, 3
-He offers 600. -Tell him to work it.	2, 5
Why, everybody knows an Omega´s worth at least 2000.	8
I agree, sir, but you know, beggars can´t be choosers, sir.	2, 5
I´m sure you did, I´m sure, corporal. Not your fault, don´t think that.	2
He´ll come back.	5
-Only 900?	6
-Two what? For what?  -lt´s your commission.	5
Boy, I don´t know how you survived in this world up to now.	1, 3
Look, let´s go through the facts of life.	1, 3, 6
And he goes home thinking that he´s taken me, so everybody´s happy.	8
That makes 1 1 20.	1
Now 1 1 20 from 2200 is $ 1 080 even. Ten percent of that is 1 08.	5, 8
Listen, on your way home, you´ll see Brant.	2
Murder!	1
Murder. I want the charge of murder sworn out.	7
He killed it.	1
-For God´s sake, do something.	1
-What do you mean? -What I said, get rid of it.	1, 2, 3
Kill it!	1
-...but let me keep my dog. -lf you don´t get away, colonel I´ll put you under arrest.	1
Grey, please take back that order, please.	6
Help! Help us.	4
Only a touch, mind.	2, 5
Yes, well, thanks for licking the spoon.	2, 4, 6, 8
No, you said pig. I didn´t say anything. Good night!	1, 7
-We´re not Chinese. -You´re hungry, aren´t you?	5, 8
-This is Hawkins´ dog.	5, 7, 8
-Sorry, sir.	2, 8
Don´t give me that. I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren´t allowed, no corrective holes.	4, 7, 8
-What do you know about this? -Why, nothing, sir.  -l don´t believe you.	1
I´m going to go outside and show everybody this...	1, 4
-...and we´ll see what they do.	4
Said he´d turn me in... -...if I didn´t help him.	7
Who are they? It doesn't matter.	2, 5
"Don't get excited, Fortnum. When we say not bad, we don't mean ""not bad.""  -We mean it's bloody marvelous."	7
What do you mean when you say it's bloody marvelous? Bit dicey.	1, 3

- Oh, where's the music, man?	2
Oh, fucking hell, man!	4
(Sicko) You're a fucking dead man!	1
(Nurse) We need an IV right now!	7
- Get off!	1

The horse is well, words to that effect. Yeah.	2
- Mr. Escalante. - Who's this?  Gus Demitriou.	2
- Get off.	6
Well, can I say for a fact that the horse is not running?	6, 7
At this point in your career, a man like Escalante... we don't get to question his intentions.	1, 3
and w-we don't ask w-why did you put us on as opposed to some other, more well-recognized jock.	2
"We say, ""this is great news, Mr. Escalante. We're gonna do you proud."""	5, 8
The Goffs million that horse won in Ireland, Joey. Keep your head on straight.	2, 3
So, if the shoe don't fit, don't wear it.	1, 3
You can fuckin' read about it later.	1
- Bernstein. - Gus, doctor.  How are you doing?	2
- Yeah. If he ain't off, I'm taking that horse away from you.  Don't you be making threats to me.	3
It's Dr. Phil. Then get out of here anyway!	2
Fine. I have other cases to hear.	3

A whole new life With a family that values what you are.	2, 5, 7
One step closer, and i'll snap her pretty neck.	1
(juliette) thank god you're here.	5, 8
A hundjager, he followed me. If one of them followed you,  There's got to be more of them around.	4
We got to go. Nick, look at me!	1
Nick, they're hundjagers.	4
- No!	2

Yeah, he's right, we got to keep moving, nick.	2, 4, 8

Take this, you'll feel better.	8
When did you get back?	7
We need you to drop something off.	2
We need to warn monroe and rosalee.	4

- Your majesty.	8
I promise i'll take care of the grimm.	8
What about josh? Is he still with us?	1, 3
Yeah, we're on our way there. Bud's driving.	1

What do we got?	5
Any connection between this one and the first two.	1, 6
There was a fourth attack tonight	4

I just can't believe it.	1, 7
(nick) we're going to need the names and vehicle information	7
(king frederick) this must be difficult, Your life changing so drastically.  You must have loved your grimm.	6
You sacrificed so much.	6, 8
A hexenbiest with your powers could be a very valuable asset To someone who respects them.  Like you?	8
We've always embraced the very things for which others Have burned you at the stake.	1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Just to be clear,	8
Well, if the queen tries anything like that with me... growls	1
Have showed up if she didn't think she was safe, Especially with the child.  Why would she come here at all?	2, 5
You didn't contact her.	1
In a court of law. Keep driving.	1
Yes, your majesty.	5, 8
I'd always heard how badass you grimms were, But your mother was a complete letdown.	7
(hank) no, no, no.	4
What if he kills nick?	2, 4
They have adalind's kid.	4, 6
I feel so bad for nick.	6
She helped the royals take her. We're going to need you on this.	8
422 mountain estate drive.	2
I'll meet you there. No.  Not this time.	1
Considering who's in the compound, My guess is it's going to be heavily guarded.	2
Just in case. Yeah, yeah, that's a really good idea,  Because if anybody does come here, it's just me and adalind,	2
(rosalee) you better come back.	2, 4, 6, 8
Uh-oh. Not good.	4
Let's not get caught in the car.	4
What about juliette?	6
You tell adalind?	2
That's out of our jurisdiction, isn't it? Yeah.	3
I'll handle it.	8
We're going on a big ship across the ocean And take you home.	2, 5

30 years ago my friends and I spent the night at a cabin. We found a book--	2
That's why I'm taking off, like, right now. Catch you flip-flop, good buddy.	4
Let it choose somebody else now.	1
Me, I'm cutting out.	6

It's good to see you, jefe.	7
What are the chances of finding that? No!	7
No, Juliette. whimpering	6
When was the last time you saw her?	6
I was holding her in my arms...	4, 6
Just take it easy.	3
- I don't know.	7
We think we got our Jack the Ripper.	2
- Call came in last night.	4, 7
All right, not now, but you need to hear this.	1
A little dicey doing a background on an FBI agent.	1
If you do it, don't do it here.	1, 4
I don't know what you think you're doing here, but you better get out of my office before you find yourself under arrest.	1, 3, 7
They just all happened to be in the same place... cell phone rings	7
Chavez has an exemplary record with the bureau.	1
- Hey, did you find him? - Oh, yeah.	2
- No, no! - groans	4

screaming breathing heavily How much longer?	3

Get her!	1
No...	6, 7
Trubel!	4
Oh, Juliette!	6
What am I saying?	1, 6
No. Are you okay?	6
Juliette's dead.	4
HANK: Nick!  It's Chavez.	4
Nick, what happened? Juliette was here last night, trying to kill me.	4
I was holding her when she died. No!	7
Okay, okay.	3
They came in from everywhere.	7
- Who? - I don't know, but it was professional.	8
Why? Was it the Royals?  No.	4, 8
She abducted Trubel once before. What the hell...	7
All right. What are you gonna do?  I'm going after her.	4
We got good news. We think we got our Jack the Ripper.	2
Okay. Hey, good work.	5
How could she be there? She got on that helicopter.	4, 7
All right, let me see if I've got this straight. Juliette does not get on that helicopter with the Royals.  Instead she goes over to Nick's house and tries to kill him.	2, 7
Hanford has extensive outdoor experience. Now, there was a possible sighting two days ago in The Dalles.	2
Send him up.	2, 4, 6, 7
Yes, sir, directly.	2, 8
Nick wants us to run a background on Chavez.	1
I need you to tell me where Theresa Rubel is.	1, 2
Theresa Rubel. Isn't that the young woman who was staying in your house?	2
Where did you take them?	7
Tell me where she is!	3
Escort him out of the building. If he resists, arrest him.	2
Also, no heads in a box. I guess that's the good news.	5, 8
It's Nick.	2, 5
I need to know where Chavez lives.	2, 8
Forget about her for a second, and get in here.	6
"The suspect's body who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copy-cat was discovered late last night..."""	7
NICK:	2, 4, 6
Captain, you don't understand... Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but you might just get yourself arrested on federal charges if you don't stop what you're doing.	1
Stop. I've been told, we're going to look into it.	1
No, I don't need time...	1, 6
Now if you don't, then I will suspend you.	1, 2
Nick wouldn't just make that up and he certainly wouldn't call and tell us that if it's not true.	1, 8
Okay, look. The last thing we knew, she was getting on that helicopter.	1, 7
This does not make any sense.	7
Have you talked to Nick?	2
It's not.	4, 6
(BREATHING DEEPLY)	6
And he's not answering.	6, 8
They took Juliette's body?	4, 6
I mean, you know, if it had to be one of them.	7
That is not what I'm saying.	6
I was starting to miss the old Juliette and now, this has happened and it just, it feels, it feels so final, you know?	6
I mean, I realize you don't have to answer me, but don't forget I helped you into this world, okay.	4, 8
Okay? We've been through a lot together.  And I don't want to see you do something, you know, without me if you really need me.	8
Nick. Get out of here!	1
I'm a little low on Maple syrup, but I've got plenty of raspberry jam.	2, 5
I know. And don't forget, you're not just eating for one.	5, 8
Bud! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	4
Like, like he's starting to... He's starting to...	4
That's normal, that's what she should be doing.	7
We have to find someone or something that ties her into this group.	2
Nick's here.	7
Steinadler.	1
Not her. Wait.  I saw the same book in her room.	7
I left it on her bed.	1
You weren't trying to find out about your fellow agent Weston Steward, you wanted to find out if Nick was a Grimm.	2
There's too much at stake.	1
St. Joe's. You got to be here.	4
It was always after eating.	7
It's really something to see. And hear, actually.  The language is something you're never gonna forget!	2
Just concentrate on this. No matter what's happened, this child is going to need you.	4, 8
She's going to need you, too.	8
You're doing fine, just take a breath.	8
No, no, no, no! Don't push!	4
What's wrong? DOCTOR:  We lost the baby's heartbeat.	6
Nick is not going to let you go unless you tell him where she is.	1
I need to send my thumb print, so they know it's me.	2, 8
I'm okay.	8
WOMAN OVER PA: Specialist to the Nursery.	8
You come with me. Alone.  And we leave in 20 minutes.	2, 8
We're just going to do nothing? For a couple of hours, yeah.	7
We walk from here. Wait.	2
You're gonna find out.	2
But how many?	4
Are you sure they're here? CHAVEZ:  They're here.	2

I'm a friend of your husband.	4
What is that?	7
I tried calling you five times.	7
What am I doing here, clark?	4
And who was that man? He -- he's a friend.	4
On my mind, that I should go to him.	4
They don't know. If they did, it would be a very different visit.  They would be bugging your phone,	4
I will figure this out.	2, 5

You know the streets.	8
You know the dealers.	3, 8
And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar, The Rat Catcher.	4
As I step into the Rat Catcher, the first thing I notice, besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss, is the tension. It's like a countdown to the next fight.	3
Well, that is about 20 miles west of here.	5
And he's wondering what you're doing in their bar.	8
Now it's show time. Do I know you?	2, 5
You wanna tell me why?	1
By the time they're done- I'm long gone, right?	8
Well, I figure I'm screwed, right? Do I run?	4, 6

Uh-huh. Eight months.	5, 7

Your bike. What's your bike?	2
Okay?	5, 7
You're gonna check in with me on a nightly basis. You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother.	1
It's a road trip and a party rolled into one. Fire it up.  And it usually results in casualties.	2
Let's roll. If I'm gonna get inside this gang and stay out of jail,  Schizo's the man I need to get to.	2, 5
The guy starts talking, so my brother picks one of them up. Shoots him right in the face.	1, 3, 8
You like to smoke, right?	2
They transferred me before I caught his name. I thought you said that they transferred him.	1, 7
Dude's name was Bongo.	2
The pretty one on the right.	5
No? What about you and Stella?	5
It's like something out of a dream.	1, 7
I have no idea.	2
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.	4
Yeah, see the problem is nobody here knows you.	2
Sure. You got a pen?	1
Because you see I got good news and I got bad news for ya.	5, 7
I fight.	2
I kill someone.	1, 3
I'm your man. Come anywhere near my old lady,	1, 3
You ever make me look stupid, you're dead.	1
Your whole story about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit.	1, 3
Harvey, I'm not an idiot, and I don't appreciate being treated like one.	1
I told you I didn't do anything illegal, and I didn't.	8
I don't care, because he sure as hell knew after.	1, 3, 6
It doesn't matter how I found out.	1
Yes, I knew, but what difference does it make?	5
We won. We didn't win, because Evan Smith has video of Donna in their offices.	1
So you're just gonna let this woman blackmail you without a fight?	1, 3
Why don't you back the hell off of her.	1
They caught me on video, and now they're threatening to press charges.	4
I'm here to tell you you made your point. (Evan) And what point is that?	6, 8
You know, it's a lot of legal rigmarole--	3
That money was gonna change my life. And if you want to go to a different law firm,	1, 2, 6
Yeah, and I wish I could keep it.	7
- Oh, that bullshit again.	1, 3
I'm not resigning my senior partnership the day after what happened happened, if that's what you're asking.	2
He's not even in yet.	1
And now what are we gonna do?	2
Harvey, there's no way the D.A. handles a case like this himself just because I work for you.	1
Harvey is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything.	1
I was wondering when you would show up.	1, 2, 3
I'm not investigating her for working for you. I'm investigating her for felony fraud.	6
Come clean right now.	4
You knew when I point-blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.	1, 3, 6
- Donna-- - I'm sorry, Harvey.	6
I know you are, but this just got 1,000 times harder for me to get out of.	4, 6
Donna, you of all people should understand by now that to me they're the same thing.	3
Like I said, good for you, but you're not gonna do it with me.	1
Hey, Joe. I can't subpoena those records without the legitimate client.	1
They didn't shut me up;	1
Joe, listen to me.	2
Since you're sitting in the corner.	1
You're usually a power table kind of girl. Well, I'm not tonight.	7
I have to decide whether he should stay at the firm.	6
Well, then I'd say the reason that you broke up is important.	8
I know you always say you're not like him, but here you are scrubbing up for the next surgery instead of fighting for the man that you love. You know what?	3
"Most sisters would say, ""I'm sorry, Jessica,"""	2
Okay, I'm aware of that, and they have all of them.	1, 2, 4
Harvey, the lawsuit is dead. We don't have a plaintiff.	1, 4, 6
(Harvey) What I'm going to do is save Mr. Wolf from being embarrassed in open court.	2
Then you know you've got a shitty witness.	1, 3
Oh, come on. It just would have been some cushy, white-collar resort.	6
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification--	1, 6
Yeah, the problem is, they already have a settlement.	4
I'm just frustrated.	3, 6
I know, but then I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you.	2
For what? You son of a bitch.  You amended the charges to intent?	1
You said it's never been done in the history of the D.A.'s office.	2
and I'm going after her for it.	1, 2
Well, we'll find out... when she's about to be convicted and I offer her a deal.	2
Well, you're going to, because you were supposed to get her out of this.	6
She's guilty.	1
Harvey didn't even know I did it. You know what?	7
- No, you're not. He's trying to get her to turn on you.	1, 3
The difference is, if you're out of the picture, Wolf backs down.	1, 3
I'm here to tell you you made your point. And what point is that?	6, 8
Your whole story about how louis got his name on the door Is bullshit.	1, 3
Might take a few days to finalize, But yeah.  It's happening.	2
Well, they went to the d.A., Which means they think you did,	4, 8
Harvey, I'm not an idiot, And I don't appreciate being treated like one.	1
You believed in it, and you fought for it,	7
We won. We didn't win,  Because evan smith has video of donna in their offices.	1
They have the opposing counsel's secretary Poking around in their goddamn file room.	1
So you're just gonna let this woman Blackmail you without a fight?	1, 3
What are you doing here? We have a situation.	7
I didn't get a chance to tell him,	6
Last year, she tried to get arbor day off,	7
And now they're threatening to press charges.	4
I'm here to tell you you made your point. (evan) and what point is that?	6, 8
If you drop any charges against donna,	1
We'll drop the lawsuit against you.	4, 8
Because you have no case.	3
No case? Your client put a faulty train on those tracks,	3
And where I come from, You cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking.	1, 2
Maybe you should have thought of that Before you sent her to rob my client.	1, 3
We have to drop the case. What the hell are you talking about?	6
We had drinks last night.	1, 7
I can't. What do you mean, you can't?	4, 6
That money was gonna change my life.	1
And if you want to go to a different law firm,	1, 2, 6
To be looped in on my schedule.	7
I'm not resigning my senior partnership The day after what happened happened,  If that's what you're asking.	2
He's not even in yet. Well, you tell him not to file anything,	1
Harvey, there's no way the d.A. Handles a case like this himself Just because I work for you.	1
And then I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away.	1, 3, 7
harvey is out there right now Busting his ass to fix everything.	1
Ha-ha. You don't seem the least bit worried  About the pending charges against your secretary.	7
Well, you know what I think? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong.  Listen to me.	1, 6
And the last time you were in my office, You told me you hadn't committed a crime to get the job done.	1
Because they prove liberty rail actually committed a crime,	6, 8
The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her She was with the national transportation safety board.	7
Come clean right now. I--	4
You knew when I point-blank asked you, And you lied to me about it.	1, 3, 6
- I'm sorry, harvey.	6
Donna, you of all people should understand by now That to me they're the same thing.	3
Hey, joe. I can't subpoena those records without the legitimate client.	1
They didn't shut me up; you did.	1
Joe, listen to me. If the check hasn't cleared, we can still get out of it.	2
I have to decide whether he should stay at the firm. Well, then I'd say the reason that you broke up is important.	6
And I don't want to get into it right now,	8
But here you are scrubbing up for the next surgery Instead of fighting for the man that you love.  You know what?	3
"Most sisters would say, ""I'm sorry, jessica,"""	2
And if you want something sugarcoated,	2, 5
How did donna injure liberty rail? - You know how.	4
Harvey, the lawsuit is dead.	8
We don't have a plaintiff.	1, 4, 6
(harvey) what I'm going to do is save mr. Wolf  From being embarrassed in open court.	2
But she can't say that, which means all donna stole	2
I know the law.	5
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification-- It wouldn't have been.	1, 6
Her goddamn sister tripped and fell in the tub,	1
You said it's never been done In the history of the d.A.'s office.	2
She went in there to find the hope diamond. Just because she came out with a piece of glass  Doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.	4, 6
Every time I run into you, You tell me whatever shady thing just went down	1
And I'm going after her for it.	1, 2
Well, we'll find out... When she's about to be convicted  And I offer her a deal.	2
Donna, intent to commit fraud is a bullshit charge,	6
Get her out of this.	6
- Because I'm taking over. - No, you're not.	1, 3
The difference is, if you're out of the picture, wolf backs down.	1, 3
I think it's best If I don't see you guys anymore.	1

Cops dropped out after two years. A lost decade, but it was worth it to make your father pay for my loss.	1
Jane's been taken too.	2, 4
from innocent, hard-working Americans...	3
Who the hell have I been dating? I could ask you the same question.	1, 2
Put it down!	1
She gives the money to the kidnappers, the kids go free.	2
Patterson, get a team out there now. We need to intercept them before they pay that ransom.	2

And what she did was she... brought her into a life of hell.	3, 6
And so I clicked it and... there was the pictures of my daughter.	7
Kubiiki I was thinking that everyone that played a part in the damage to my child should be held responsible.	1
And the demand is huge. Yiota The majority of children that we see trafficked online have been trafficked on Backpage.	3
Nacole I didn't even recognize her.	7
Nacole I don't think everybody goes through life thinking about child sex trafficking in the United States.	6
Nacole I knew that there had been a trial out of Missouri, so my first thought was to contact that attorney and see how it was going over there.	2
Brad So far you haven't given us any information	1
Jessica NCMEC has a slightly different view of its interactions with Backpage.	6
man I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been 14 or 15 at least once a week.	6
Tom She puts the same information out there, Collects her paycheck, and somehow she sleeps at night.	3, 7
J.S. I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me.	6
Michael Well, I do think it is difficult to let go, but believe me, the people we worked with were happy to have us let go.	2, 8
Erik One of the theories we have is that Backpage is, in fact, in a conspiracy with the pimps, that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking, but in fact, are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement.	1, 3
Jane's mother They're saying they're not responsible for what people put on their website.	1
John I had got addicted to watching porn.	3, 6
Jason He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	5
Nacole I remember being at the courthouse, and there were people outside holding signs and I thought, you know, how cool to have all this support.	5
woman We saw a real-life example of this last week...	3
Jane There are definitely people who feel like it's your fault.	1
Rob The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking, the more Backpage comes up.	3, 6
John We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place.	6
Claire Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed?	7
"woman You think he's gonna say, ""I've had it""?"	7
Marian He's put his neck on the chopping block.	1, 4, 6
I love Erik Bauer. chuckles	5, 8
Jane It was a blessing and God was watching over us that day when they made that decision.	5
Jane's mother You know, we might actually have a voice that would do something.	2
Nacole It's hard, this fight.	6
-man Yes.	8
Senator Can you explain your testimony that there is more stringent posting rules for selling a motorcycle than selling a 12-year-old?	1
man I take it you agree that it is possible for a publisher to also be a participant in a sex trafficking venture, where the pimp himself runs a website.	2
man I think Ropes Gray will win.	2, 8
J.S. The guilt and just feeling ashamed of yourself, I've struggled a lot with that.	8
J.S. I have to live every single day of my life now with everything that's happened to me.	6
Kubiiki It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or, you can see all of the evidence and you cannot feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right.	1
woman How long will you be able to keep the litigation going on your own resources?	1
woman You'll sell the furniture?	1, 7
David There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be, whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children.	4, 6
Nacole Oh, my gosh, she was bubbly and outgoing.	2
woman She just had a real spice for life.	2, 5
woman It's time for us all to stand up and be strong.	2
woman And that's the only way to make change, is to make your voice known.	4, 8
