1	When a threatening power lands in our capital we don't meet them with tea and cookies.
1	Shut the fuck up.
1	Fine! But I'm not making a speech.
1	I take it for granted that a person of an innocent state of mind... Would rule himself out as a suspect... And save a busy detective from wasting time.
1	Get out of the way!
1	So, don't try to impress me with numbers.
1	Open the door, asshole!
1	No good asking you!
1	Move!
1	I got my rights!
1	Just get out of my house.
1	I am the medical examiner and the chief pathologist in the city, and they've cut me out.
1	No time to argue.
1	Turn me loose and get out.
1	Every one of them terrible.
1	No deal!
1	You're late.
1	Find someone else to sing about.
1	You just move!
1	Hey, what the fuck?
1	Trying to kill me. Is that it?
1	This bloody sod accused me of stealing me mate's grub.
1	Come on, Jessie, move over.
1	And I want Brian and Charlie... dead!
1	Behave yourself.
1	Finally.
1	No flags, nothing like that.
1	Nick wouldn't just make that up, and he certainly wouldn't call and tell us that if it's not true.
1	Wait till they get a load of me.
1	I'm not required to do your public relations.
1	No, it's not.
1	Now you've had it!
1	Remember that in the years ahead when you're directing cigarette butts on television!
1	Say, don't annoy me.
1	That the best you can do?
1	My nightmares is more like it.
1	They're shit, Amy.
1	I'll keep her off the screen. I'll destroy her. No.
1	I swear. I don't know where you get it from. But you!
1	More money for the Pentagon when it's own auditors admit the military cannot account for % of what it already spends.
1	You put asses into seats.
1	Throw him in the car.
1	Don't move!
1	I need to talk to her.
1	He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust, the only thing that'll put this bank on safe ground.
1	Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore.
1	Who the hell are you working for?
1	I ain't making no money watching you boys sleep.
1	And you're gonna have to blow me up too!
1	I hope you get in trouble some day!
1	I sure hate to lose her for some reason or other.
1	Don't let that cop get away with this.
1	Wait till I ask Dad if this is any way to run an airline.
1	He's mad. It was an accident.
1	Now get the smile off your face.
1	Why don't you" try it?"
1	Dickhead.
1	Maybe a kick in his skull would do him some good.
1	I've never told you how to live it and never interfered.
1	I never signed any contract!
1	Well, run out and get him!
1	If you want to get into that cellar, you get in there now or forget it!
1	You won't cheat Melly out of publicly ordering you out of her house.
1	Son of a bitch!
1	Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords?
1	Sit... down.
1	And don't try anything funny, cos you know what you'll get.
1	Don't exaggerate.
1	Goddamn it, Audrey.
1	Like I said, good for you. But you're not going to do it with me.
1	Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule.
1	I can't believe you did this-- A $, suit on my credit card.
1	No, no pictures.
1	Do not say that.
1	We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first.
1	What the hell is this?
1	Look, the tone of this is so unprofessional.
1	They have every right to invade ours.
1	You!
1	What are you smilin' at?
1	Get them!
1	I was, up to the minute I saw this test.
1	What the hell are you talking about? We had drinks last night.
1	I want the whole morning edition a blast to push him off the floor.
1	For the love of God, Johnnie.
1	Well, I ain't scared.
1	God took them because of my wicked thoughts! No.
1	How may times do I have to tell you?
1	Meaning what, that I have no money? -l don't know.
1	Will you shut up?
1	Alright, knock it off!
1	You just wait.
1	Anna olla!,I told him my problem, I told him I loved you and he told me to keep my trap shut.
1	Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election will get itself resolved.
1	Don't touch me.
1	Your whore.
1	Damn.
1	Why didn't you tell me before my wife left?
1	Don't show it to me.
1	Hold him!
1	Son of a bitch!
1	He's an idiot.
1	And you wanna know what else I think?
1	And you think I don't?
1	l hate this part.
1	Would you have preferred the Verua kill me?
1	Harvey, I'm not an idiot and I don't appreciate being treated like one.
1	Don't fuck me up.
1	Can you believe it? It's too tacky.
1	You're too young to smoke!
1	For God's sake, shut that up!
1	However many questions you ask, you never expect an answer.
1	I'm not denying anything.
1	That right, mister?
1	How did this get started?
1	You put my eye out, you bitches!
1	What did I tell you, Joe?
1	You can't just run off.
1	But he didn't give a shit.
1	Now that particular statement really pissed me off, because I don't think Congress did any such thing.
1	Except you honked the fucking horn.
1	Don't start, Mike.
1	He blows it.
1	Yeah, do you mind?
1	l swear on the Virgin, nobody knows!
1	Damn!
1	They're out there.
1	Get out of the way!
1	Coochie...
1	Yeah, call the cops.
1	Don't you raise your voice to me!
1	What the hell are you trying to do to me?
1	Pa's no killer!
1	He'll never leave Russia. Then let him stay.
1	Open the goddamn door, Alice!
1	Don't you see me standing right here?
1	I did not ask your advice.
1	There is to be no retreat, not so much as one millimeter.
1	Cooper, give me the nails over there!
1	Is it possible to bring you back to reality for one moment?
1	End of the line, asshole.
1	Do you think I do?
1	I'll kill him!
1	I'll kill him and his bloody beast.
1	Stop!
1	You return to the front of your army.
1	Grab this oar.
1	Is that right, Shooter?
1	Of course I'm talking about Delta, you twerp!
1	Right away, Nick? No.
1	Move it, man, move it!
1	Don't slouch.
1	You better be careful.
1	Nobody gives a shit, believe me!
1	The point is of no return... and you've reached it!
1	What did I tell you?
1	You do as I say or the pig dies.
1	How could he say a thing like that?
1	You British insult easy. Can't catch one of these cruds passing up a buck.
1	We'll arrest him.
1	Marty Weiner has disappeared.
1	I told you not to come into the lobby.
1	Then you don't approve.
1	You're the serious one.
1	That will be enough, Hans.
1	I used to drive a tank when I was in the army, but look at me now!
1	Fog your mind so you can't remember a darn thing.
1	Where is Nasser?
1	Christ. I don't know what you've been up to, but Garcia is pissing fire.
1	That's him!
1	Cause I said so.
1	It's not Russia.
1	That's enough.
1	That's him.
1	I hate these things.
1	Mind keeping that door closed, please?
1	I warn you, colonel if I am to die, others will die before me.
1	l can't stand this shit. - Hey, Luis, please.
1	We ran those prints through the federal computer. Turns out they belong to one Carol Hunnicut. She's arrested for disorderly conduct in , in Oregon, some kind of antinuke bullshit.
1	Nobody messes with the Healys!
1	I don't want any luck.
1	You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there, but the subtle truth is you really don't want me to go down there.
1	I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
1	What do you mean, you're downstairs, you idiot?
1	How can you say such a thing?
1	Stand back, Inspector, or I'll shoot you.
1	Well, stop it!
1	Are you off your trolley?
1	That son of a bitch is getting away with it.
1	Nobody has any reasons I don't know about.
1	Some poor son of a bitch on a public-indecency charge... Paid off a PA to have his case dismissed.
1	Are you mocking me?
1	As medical officer, I protest to the way he's being treated.
1	As much as I would regret saving his.
1	Was it you?
1	And what will you do then, Harry?
1	Where do you think I've been?
1	I'll use my magic to banish them!
1	Sweet musical Jesus, that's your friend?
1	Why don't you like him?
1	This is no time to play in the snow.
1	Let me borrow that pen again.
1	Wear 'em on your collar.
1	Might hit him on the head with one.
1	Willie, it's getting late.
1	God damn it.
1	And you can't make me.
1	Autographed by the criminal himself. Hey, buddy, are you gonna read it or buy it?
1	We're going around in circles.
1	You know I'm gonna be the president, right?
1	No, not today.
1	I'm gonna do it alone!
1	No, no, no, no, no.
1	Don't fuck with me on this one, Luis.
1	Come on!
1	Two against one?
1	You gotta be joking. - I neverjoke about money.
1	Well, what's there to talk about?
1	Just get out.
1	Go on, go to work.
1	That's what you're living with, a couple of real boy scouts!
1	I didn't hurt anyone!
1	No time to argue.
1	I was at home with my baby mother!
1	Yeah, yeah, yeah...
1	I'll kill you bitches!
1	Bury them for 24,hours, give me time!
1	Well, he'd better be if he's gonna remain anything at all.
1	Give me a break, we just met!
1	You can't take a bill nobody's heard of and discuss it among 96,men.
1	Tell them to leave.
1	Let's forget it.
1	That Englishman wants a fight?
1	Hit him, Dad.
1	Did it ever occur to you, Harry, that the prince looked everywhere for Cinderella just so that he could put the shoe back on her foot?
1	And what does he want?
1	I wanna hurt him! I wanna suck out his eyes!
1	Is this record correct or not?
1	But you're affecting the lives of a lot of other people.
1	Hey!
1	Nobody goes no place here without I say so.
1	My lawyer will get all this information, along with a doctor's report about my stomach and her ankle.
1	You scared me.
1	When I got back, we were short two blokes' rations.
1	You call this a tip, you cheap bastard? !
1	What's keeping you?
1	Your Honor, isn't that a question for the jury?
1	Nobody leaves unless I say so.
1	We don't want advantages, and we don't want prejudices.
1	The worst would be a relief.
1	Don't "Your Majesty" me!
1	I beg your pardon? I leave tomorrow morning for Cannes.
1	They saw something they weren't supposed to see.
1	Your parents have been calling all day long.
1	Alright, have it any way you want!
1	We haven't anything to discuss with you.
1	We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.
1	I don't want to part with it even in death
1	What the hell is this, Decker?
1	Are you going to come or do I have to drag you?
1	He'd kill you if he heard you.
1	Well, I'm no loser.
1	Leave everything to me. Shoo, shoo.
1	Aren't you supposed to know that? Isn't that your job? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you?
1	I can have you arrested!
1	Jesus fucking christ. - $? - Yes, sir.
1	Driver, I'm a little disappointed in you!
1	Tell me what you gave to him!
1	Your plastic's not gonna help you now, you lousy little fuck.
1	To forget one day your only obsession:
1	I just want to have my shipyard.
1	My seat belt's too tight.
1	Like I said, they'll call you if they need you.
1	This is only going to make it worse for you.
1	You gave him a plane without checking with Operations?
1	We give no quarter to those that are disloyal.
1	He's put his neck on the chopping block.
1	Now, if you don't, then I will suspend you.
1	Especially not to throw away your career with this team.
1	Now, if Case doesn't kill us, the Triads will.
1	Ka-rumph! We were smashed to port.
1	I will complete the task. Out.
1	You stupid...
1	I am speaking strictly, Hasslein.
1	Tara? What kind of a name is that?
1	Don't give me that. I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed, no corrective holes.
1	He won't open the safe.
1	Then, unless you want to spend the next 20,years of your life in prison, you will do exactly what I tell you, when I tell you.
1	I've had just about enough of you two.
1	And whoever holds Ireland points a dagger at the heart of England.
1	Take that sentence back!
1	I need them yesterday.
1	Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh. -Dress it. Quickly.
1	Assholes trying to round them up and put them in the back of trucks.
1	You bastard!
1	Why did you say Balboa's better?
1	If you're saying what I'm thinking you're saying, you better not say it because I don't wanna hear it.
1	Are you saying you're insane? Is that your defense? - Plus she took a lot of prescription medicine.
1	I never should've left.
1	Don't pretend you don't know the reason.
1	God-damn it!
1	I want to kill you.
1	If you continue to annoy me about this girl... who is no responsibility of mine, I'll have you arrested.
1	And what sort of rubbish are you turning out now?
1	This is plain stubbornness and you know it.
1	It's not that you fuck around a lot. It's that you lie about it.
1	I have rights.
1	And what point is that?
1	With you guys it's always bad timing.
1	The point is, you give the guy money, he jumps into bed.
1	Typical!
1	Who are you?
1	And I don't share my husband with anyone!
1	Shut up, Mary. If you repent, hand that stolen money over to me.
1	Now, this is as good a time as any, Harry, to get our relationship straight once and for all.
1	You don't know how to train?
1	I never promised to be no hero, did I?
1	That telegram from Moscow, why should you bother about it?
1	You can't order me to do that.
1	Listen, you son of a bitch.
1	If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
1	What? Chavez has an exemplary record with the bureau.
1	Just take your meat and get out.
1	Like a velvet glove cast in iron, and like the gas chamber, Varla, a real fun gal.
1	I was gonna have to stab up that lanky prick for trying to take my package anyway.
1	I know her far better than you do.
1	He'd punch on my mother, too.
1	Clear?
1	Argh! Kaili!
1	You know I don't understand that shit.
1	You protest too much.
1	It's a crime against the people who sent me here!
1	Come on!
1	I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them.
1	I'm getting tired of this.
1	Harvey, the lawsuit's dead. We don't have a plaintiff.
1	Okay, we'll do it, but I want to hear Pulovski's voice, and I mean now.
1	I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
1	But you still haven't answered me.
1	Busted.
1	Wait a minute!
1	You get out tomorrow!
1	I will not be one mind with you!
1	You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive to some.
1	And we think it's actually their job and they're not doing it.
1	I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate.
1	You bring him!
1	Stop it!
1	Think I'm a fool?
1	He's lying, mom.
1	And the sociopaths that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to speak for planet Earth.
1	The firm's having withdrawal pains at the bank, if it's any of your bloody business.
1	When I gave these files to her, they were in nice order.
1	I get twice the work done around here. - You know why?
1	And don't waste none of his time, because he ain't staying around long.
1	Yeah, but you're fucking doing it.
1	You don't know me.
1	You proud to have that animal for kin?
1	Yeah! Yeah... Yes!
1	Stop it!
1	You didn't have to do that.
1	You can't drive and shoot.
1	Have they moved the embassy, or are you hijacking me?
1	Hey, you told me the only way you survive is because you're a team.
1	And I want a list of everybody's budgets, research accounts and financials on my desk by tomorrow.
1	Let's kill him now.
1	Now, I happen to know of a prick that's responsible for the whole fucking operation and that son of bitch is hurting out there, and I'm fucking liking it.
1	I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.
1	Asking who I sleep with isn't personal anymore? What do you want to know, if I smoke?
1	I've already seen a doctor.
1	Being right ain't gonna do us any good.
1	What does it matter?
1	I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
1	You are wrong, Menelaus.
1	It's fucking embarrassing.
1	Hey, wait a minute!
1	I wouldn't give two cents for all your fancy rules if behind them they didn't have plain, ordinary everyday kindness.
1	We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.
1	I killed a man I hated today.
1	Fire the security department!
1	Look, I was never at Christine's house.
1	Flo, if I wanted anything else, I'd call Sylvester here.
1	You didn't think I was dead, too, did you? Maria.
1	And if we could find it, it wouldn't have a tear.
1	Any decent church would've burnt you bastards years ago.
1	It's him I'm asking, Marie, not you. See?
1	Are you blind?
1	No thanks.
1	Knock it off!
1	Keep your voice down!
1	Once you're out of here never come back!
1	Listen to me and keep still.
1	I can't have children, Tommy!
1	Will somebody shut him up?
1	Issues? Bullshit.
1	Lay off.
1	Who you trying to kid, sister?
1	No! We're extracting! Give me the breaching charges!
1	You have any idea what you're doing to that poor woman?
1	Now! - Let me go!
1	We don't like Razinin.
1	I have no intention of drowning with you.
1	Kill him!
1	Now, by my watch, does not mean in the morning, but :.
1	Like hell it isn't.
1	It's not like you let me do anything anyway.
1	Turned out that my father and his business partner were involved in a Ponzi scheme.
1	Did you get drunk, dance in your underwear, and sing sea shanties?
1	Just shut up about her, all right?
1	You're not telling me anything I don't know.
1	Don't ever do that to me again!
1	Back in the village when they made fun of you, I wanted to kill them.
1	You're sorry?
1	David hates caffeine.
1	Bridge...
1	Come on, do what I tell you!
1	We gotta let him out!
1	You think you're my boss?
2	More chanting! Father!
2	You know how much I enjoy your high style of playing.
2	You come in and sit a minute with me.
2	You know, there's no alcohol in water.
2	Hey, Axel, how about some beer?
2	One of these days, I'm gonna spend me the rest of my life in one of these hot...
2	Oh, honey, you're gonna love these-- coconut fudge delights.
2	I'm anxious to get back to the office.
2	Oh, I'm sure they do.
2	You run along with Mammy.
2	See they're sweet, daddy?
2	Let's try this...
2	You might be an interesting subject of study.
2	Why don't you try to get some sleep now? You're gonna need it.
2	We could pick it up on the way home.
2	Just a moment.
2	Why the sudden change of heart?
2	I wondered if you'd do me a favour, if you ain't busy.
2	But come sit for a minute.
2	I'll take my chances.
2	Hey, let's play With the mystic spirit board, ok?
2	I'll tell Eddington I'm engaged to Jere.
2	You'll meet him shortly.
2	Where were you?
2	Gee, I've never been to the circus before.
2	Hey, buddy. Spare some change?
2	And if I kissed it... and made a wish... it'd come true.
2	You okay?
2	I am not be fool. I am asking it to give me the honor of being my woman.
2	Coffee, sweetheart?
2	Axel, you got a cigarette?
2	You come in and sit a minute with me.
2	I put the kettle on.
2	I want to see Nathan White.
2	You have literature, art treasures, My collections, and even music if you so desire.
2	You mind if I change, honey?
2	But, she can be very generous sometimes.
2	I'll tell you what I think it was.
2	Go!
2	Let the party begin.
2	Yeah.
2	You like fishing?
2	But, they might be ready to make a go of it on their own.
2	You can talk all you want to now.
2	You think I thought this was gonna happen?
2	Attention!
2	We're ready with that live feed.
2	You could run a few thousand volts through him.
2	Go on, Tom.
2	Yes. You know the nun you spoke to last night?
2	No unpleasantness, I hope.
2	Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem, needs to be taken.
2	What have you got in there, Marlowe?
2	I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .
2	You still race?
2	What I'm going to do is save Mr. Wolf from being embarrassed in open court.
2	Pick you up in an hour.
2	This ain't the time to retire.
2	Who is it?
2	We can work all that out later, too.
2	No scars.
2	He-e-e-ere's Daddy!
2	No, because in a few hours we'll be at the Rio Grande.
2	Let's not waste any time.
2	Hey, what are you drawing there?
2	Hey, look at me!
2	Hands up!
2	Think I should go out with Paulie?
2	Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.
2	It'll put you right in the mood.
2	Great day for it. You look glorious.
2	How long will they be?
2	That is the original invitation.
2	Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me  more minutes.
2	What are we doin' here?
2	Well, we want our dough.
2	This will make you famous, hmm?
2	Won't you tell us all about it?
2	Think fast.
2	Go, Vinnie!
2	Where would we like it?
2	Try the freeze" curse!"
2	This is an important assignment.
2	We're going to Argentina, like you wanted.
2	Thanks for the recap.
2	Thank God you're all right.
2	What can I get for you?
2	Let me try.
2	I have been thinking about you. Really?
2	You want to give the bankers good news tomorrow.
2	Everybody's waiting.
2	How's it taste?
2	It doesn't matter. They run a little family grocery shop back home.
2	Now, get!
2	I promised my body to a woman tonight.
2	Gather around, me buckoes, and feast your eyes on this.
2	It's simple and I'm helping, so we knock it off in three or four days.
2	Try the basement.
2	Oh my God.
2	Your blood will be on fire to lead some new command, some far adventure.
2	I mean... except with you.
2	Where is this manuscript?
2	What is it?
2	The world will someday see paintings of her. And of her and me. And then it will think,
2	With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
2	Go to your AA meetings-- -l want to do this film.
2	I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.
2	We're going sailing.
2	Take the day off.
2	Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
2	You got a minute?
2	That Englishman wants a fight?
2	Oh, my gosh, she was bubbly and outgoing.
2	Tonight we'll meet our contacts.
2	Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
2	Maybe she has a sister.
2	What happened?
2	Excellent. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm hungry.
2	Oh, I've been hearing about you for a couple of years now.
2	This will be our child.
2	Better make it tomorrow.
2	We'll take care of her later, eh?
2	Atreyu, get real!
2	Then when I'm good and ready, we come out with a big extra.
2	You got time for a drink?
2	The next day I call Samantha Kiles.
2	For your next fight, try the redhead in the front row.
2	Mr. Kersey, you wanna join the party?
2	We can get cheap tickets from Jessica's parents.

2	Let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey.
2	His place? You've walked into his places all unsuspecting many, many times.

2	Soon we will expand from city to city.
2	Just a little more, a little further...
2	Have you thought that your child is in the Piedmont?
2	They must be there.
2	He'll be a champ.
2	It's all right. I'll have to bring our sledge. Hurry.
2	I'll see you inside.
2	Let's belly up to the bar and get us some refreshment.
2	When we invade France, What will the help of Spain?
2	It all began one night when the lights went out.,
2	Just give me five minutes.
2	Could I get some extra mayo?
2	Hey Fonzie, come here and help your grandma for a minute.
2	Where did you get it?
2	Do you have any experience?
2	If he speaks on your behalf justice will triumph
2	Back down! -All right, all right, all right.
2	It's a small part, but the producer said the next picture I'll have a bigger part.
2	Let me ask you something.
2	Do you have any idea when it'll be ready?
2	It's for you, the famous Ringo.
2	Just get the head.
2	Jethro just texted me to meet him, but call me back as soon as you can, okay?
2	It won't be long now, comrades.
2	For an hour. An hour?
2	Where did you get this?
2	Still a lot of soldiers around Better get inside
2	Just like before!
2	There's a good chance that she'll respond.
2	Look, I take my medications. My problem isn't compliance.
2	Just like we're gonna find a big hunk of that long green.
2	Do you have a gun?
2	People sense these things.
2	Where do we go to surrender?
2	Ladies and gentlemen, the big event you've been waiting for.
2	Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.
2	Ostentatious, that is!
2	We'll be in the station soon. You'll be safe when we get there.
2	I knew you'd come. I was... I was waiting!
2	Okay, we're all going into the vault now.
2	Will you stay the week?
2	So do you draw all the dads and their kids?
2	It should be fun doing some detective work.
2	Why don't you move in here permanently?
2	There was no way she would have showed up if she didn't think she was safe, especially with the child.
2	I couldn't possibly sit still.
2	You're gonna be a father.
2	He'll hate it, but he'll do it.
2	You're wanted in Plot.
2	I have heard that the King is ....
2	Warren, shall we continue to plan?
2	How are you doing?
2	You're probably not interested.
2	So, we intend to pursue this matter... Until we have a full understanding on how it bears on the truth.
2	She may be the next first lady.
2	You will dine with me?
2	Inclined to hound subordinates about small details?
2	Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
2	Think they'll give me a job of responsibility?
2	How do you feel?
2	We're here to have fun.
2	Did you decode the message?
2	Come on, buddy.
2	We're going airborne!
2	Oh, don't worry about it, Captain.
2	Let's go to some other place.
2	I hope I shall.
2	It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours.
2	Of course she know them perfectly.
2	The reason Congress enacted Section  in the first place was because of a lawsuit filed by Stratton Oakmont, the boiler-room securities operation founded by Jordan Belfort, better known as The Wolf of Wall Street.
2	And if you don't like anyone, you just give me the sign and...out.
2	Darling, tell me, when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia?
2	We're standing on the brink of a new world, and...
2	We only have  minutes on safe window of operation.
2	Yo, Todd. Hey, how you doing?
2	I hope Hank wasn't bothering you.
2	Good luck.
2	Having a nice time?
2	We'll keep her here, won't we?
2	What do you know?
2	And make some primo dinner reservations at Margaux. For  o'clock.
2	Shoot her now.
2	I only hope that you're good enough for the Caine.
2	And if I kissed it... and made a wish... it'd come true.
2	Don't you think he's got a point?
2	We'll have to find new opportunities.
2	Your job is to talk first.
2	Get pencils and paper, quick!
2	That'll do it.
2	Would you mind giving me a hand?
2	Yes, I'm playing tonight.
2	And we desperately want to get out of organized crime.
2	I got to catch that boat.
2	I gotta impress the British.
2	With a little left over for Neal Owynn?
2	They're going to choose you. I just know it.
2	How long are you staying?
2	I don't know what caused this great interest in us?
2	I can't wait. Heh heh.
2	One matters of saying to us, Mr. Inglethorp, where it was in the Monday afternoon, day  of June?
2	Where's the whiny guy?
2	Why not a couple more fights?
2	I know where it is.
2	Open it.
2	I've missed you.
2	Okay, girls, go get them!
2	The whole place is gonna blow?
2	Yeah, and in this heat... I mean, BO and barbecue!
2	I want to drink a toast to you.
2	I hope that you will uphold justice
2	Now, you mind if I dance with your wife?
2	We could go see Valley of the Dolls.
2	Could Halsey's carriers do a reconnaissance job for us?
2	Would you like to see me?
2	How are you doing?
2	May I? May I?
2	When I say run, run.
2	When my sister sees you she'll be so happy for me
2	If we can force them to come in and face us, we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape.
2	If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals.
2	The shipment arrives, we nail them.
2	Finally.
2	As soon as I get it, we'll make tracks.
2	If you ever want anything, anything at all, just ask for Brian.
2	Hurry up, students. Five more minutes for your pen- pals.
2	Yes, but there's something I want...
2	We did it, Mr. Cassidy.
2	Oh, of course.
2	He may not be able to use a spoon.
2	Oh, wait!
2	We'll have a crew yet!
2	You wanted to find out if Nick was a Grimm.
2	Most people will feel good riddance.
2	Having fun?
2	Water!
2	Hey, look at this.
2	We don't wanna miss her, boy, we wanna get there first.
2	Bob's looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink.
2	Did you bring me a present?
2	I want to feel my bones burst into a billion pieces!
2	I'll be back.
2	Have multiple targets sighted.
2	Come on, Chappie. There's fish in the stream.
2	Well, now I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
2	Now, you must fly out immediately!
2	If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory, it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage.
2	I wish I could spend more than two hours with you.
2	My good Dorcas, the Lady Inglethorp is killed and it is necessary to know everything to be able to avenge it.
2	Oh, no, no, no. I want to hear more about this.
2	And, Robin, I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP.
2	We'll have a crew yet!
2	Gold!
2	What'll we drink to?
2	What's all this interference?
2	Come see me in the morning.
2	Let's take a walk.
2	Let's talk reality.
3	I'll blacken this punk so he'll...
3	I want them booked on felony charges, destruction of private property, and assault.
3	Would we have approved killing him in babyhood when he was innocent, or killing his mother, or slaughtering his remote ancestors?
3	Stand by and see his wife insulted?
3	Well, she simply said that you're a fat, pompous, bad-tempered old tyrant.
3	Don't come back here" - that's a bit like saying: "Do not read this note"."
3	He's ready for a fall.
3	I can't take any more of this.
3	But the gun shoots death and purifies the earth of the filth of brutals.
3	What? Get off my coat!
3	These stalls are awfully dirty and they're backed up.
3	You're just a product.
3	Both those guys on the trailer are in it.
3	You're a fool.
3	What do you think of a man who's unfaithful to his wife?
3	Leonid is stupid.
3	What sucker would buy the Chiefs?
3	Even if this room gets filled with lies like these and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place.
3	Yeah? The last time you assured me, I lost good men in the Kola Peninsula.
3	I want you to know that I hate your fucking guts.
3	You murdered your own brother. -You murdered your brother.
3	They let you in again?
3	What is it now?
3	I can't tell the boy from a doorpost.
3	I hate this place.
3	I've seen better fights on a light show!
3	You don't get it, do you?
3	You hurt me. Yes.
3	You ain't learned yet who's running this show.
3	Let's hurry up and bury this bastard. I'm fucking knackered.
3	You fooled this young whippersnapper, but you didn't fool nobody else!
3	You a fifty-dollar whore? - What are you doing?
3	I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something.
3	You girls a bunch of nudists? Or you just, uh, short of clothes?
3	Shit!
3	Like a velvet glove cast in iron, and like the gas chamber, Varla, a real fun gal.
3	You speak to me of code?
3	He's peeing on me.
3	They just have felonies.
3	What can you expect from filthy little heathens?
3	Yes, I do. - No, you can't!
3	What I would like is for you to get down.
3	Let's get outta here!
3	What have you been drinking?
3	And as for you... whatever it is you're hatching, forget it, or end up dead.
3	This is idiotic, Francis.
3	Years ago, when we still had executions in the state he used to volunteer as a witness.
3	Bought in to fool people into thinking they were aliens, yeah.
3	Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
3	Probably turned into some potluck, poster-making, sing-along.
3	You're gonna be outta work, you keep scamming like you are.
3	Are you really that quiet?
3	He's not making a whole lot of sense.
3	If it's so nutritious, how come I don't see you eating it?
3	There will come a time, when those who sit above me will want you delivered.
3	What use is courage if you have no head?
3	Well, I know you ain't confusing yourself with getting in shape to ride again.
3	I lied.
3	We can't stop at anything until we've smashed this yokel...
3	Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.
3	I will not ever sit on those eggs!
3	Happy? !
3	You don't give a shit about him.
3	And we are no longer victims of this violent, convulsive act, which so debased women and betrayed men.
3	Wait till somebody gets killed?
3	You fat, disgusting slob!
3	What I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you let me wear my clothes?
3	Show me how to punish Perseus for this blasphemy!
3	How about paying for something you drop by accident?
3	You place an absurd value On the cheapest of human commodities.
3	He laid me out, strung me up and then...
3	Go ahead, [GAY SLUR].
3	He might win a few fights, but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
3	You're men!
3	I knew you were gonna say that.
3	Get naked and tell me the truth about my money.
3	Get a job, dummy.
3	Is there no justice in the world?
3	He leveraged himself up to his eyeballs. The investments didn't work out... He got himself in serious debt.
3	Also, I don't like nobody touching me.
3	You son of a bitch.
3	You thought you done good, she'll get us all killed.
3	He don't get it.
3	He had a bad moustache, a lot of bad habits.
3	All happened on your watch.
3	He did that night.
3	He likes to kick the shit out of white trash like you, boy.
3	He ain't gonna put out  bucks on a lousy pair.
3	You don't know a dam from a bathtub.
3	Get in.
3	Why don't you run on home, or you'll get hurt worse than before, [GAY SLUR].
3	He is unworthy of command.
3	I told him his wife was a dyke.
3	You really believe you can frighten me?
3	You dirty rat.
3	Certainly making a fool of yourself.
3	You've cost me millions and millions of francs.
3	Fuck you.
3	He owes me $, and won't pay up.
3	Fucking honey dripper.
3	Get rid of him, Clive.
3	Fucking cannibal.
3	He hates everybody.
3	These assholes have been after me for my sources and you're...
3	You slimy toad.
3	Ladies and gentlemen, these photos depict horrors...
3	He never spoke.
3	But you're lying.
3	Only to be met by this fresh and superior attitude of yours.
3	So if you're bad often enough, you'll die.
3	Just grow up and go to sleep.
3	Alas, if he were brave this would not be necessary.
3	No case? Your client put a faulty train on those tracks, people died, and they knew it could happen the whole time.
3	You sit and discuss your sports and your young ladies and...
3	Come on out, you bastards!
3	I think you're stupid.
3	Nothin' man. Whatever.
3	Oi!
3	And that's my mother...running away.
3	And then one day I went into the barn... and there he was.
3	You're passing up the whitest man on earth for a dirty, no-good...
3	I don't pay you good money to have you jerk me around.
3	Of course she know them perfectly.
3	Knew we'd be too obsessed by the perpetrator inside the bank to see much more than a beard or a blond or a whiny jerk. What do you got?
3	I don't think I want body-to-body contact.
3	I know all those stories.
3	You big baby.
3	I forgot about it.
3	Those boys just destroyed my station house and two of my cars.
3	Once you're out of here never come back!
3	Nobody's on it because she's a junkie, and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto, which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.
3	No man, woman or beast will ever desire you again.
3	He sweats gasoline that man!
3	That is ridiculous.
3	I can't think of anything more sappy.
3	Pure acid!
3	There are whores in Gorky Park who have carved my name on trees.
3	Scrub all day and I can still smell it...
3	You can just fucking die, you fuck.
3	You're fucking stabbing me in the back, man.
3	LA is up for grabs, the spoils of our once fine city going to the ruthless scum who can spread the most carnage and blood in our streets.
3	No, don't do it.
3	Fuck you!
3	Nobody knows what goes on inside a police car, right, Mike?
3	That you don't want to live here, or in Chicago, or San Francisco, or any other place where people have to live on top of each other, and they don't have enough room to walk, or breath, or smile.
3	Right now, I wish it had been.
3	Nobody makes a fool out of my wife.
3	That's kinda sick, huh?
3	Just wait till he's looking down your throat, that's all.
3	The fucker was holdin' on till he could scrounge a job.
3	Now we're even.
3	That I had to chew his ass to get him to move on it. He seemed more interested in if, when and how... I was fucking Carolyn Polhemus than in his own investigation.
3	Must you flirt?
3	Do something with yourself for pity's sakes.
3	Schmuck, listen to me.
3	I'm going to puke
3	Most people think they're beautiful dresses on beautiful women.
3	Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd?
3	Why don't you do your sorry ass a favor?
3	What is with you? What goes with you?
3	We don't tolerate nudity in any shape or form.
3	The whole world sucks.
3	You don't get the truth in the Senate.
3	How come they're happier than us?
3	Her father murdered her mother.
3	I will show you freaky...
3	Oh, my God, what an idiot.
3	You letting this joker give orders?
3	I'm not coming.
3	You break in here, and you tell me you think Paul's a murderer.
3	And the other time.
3	Raymond knew he was taking bribes?
3	One of the theories we have is that Backpage is, in fact, in a conspiracy with the pimps, that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking, but in fact, are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement.
3	Fuck Ohio.
3	You thought that everything would happen behind your back, ... For your secret mission.
3	Christine, I can't make it so soon...
3	Everybody forgot about it but me.
3	I'm not available.
3	I mean, aside from all of this junk.
3	We don't want Mario to come, the bald giant with stupid sunglasses, knocking everybody around for kicks.
3	I'm sorry, Willie.
3	We'll let them decide. Face the window.
3	Please sit down, sober up.
3	Bodies strung out, bodies with the skins ripped off, the hearts torn from the cadavers.
3	You picked up that awful thing to show us your contempt.
3	Just wait till he's looking down your throat, that's all.
3	I got stupid.
3	You know, it's a lot of legal rigmarole.
3	Look how stupid you're acting.
3	I'm your man. Come anywhere near my old lady, I'll cut your balls off, asshole.
3	Right now she has murder in her heart.
3	Monster! He's hiding my Kim!
3	The King wants to take the wife of his cousin.
3	RJ and Feather could move there, and he could be the mayor of Stupidville. Stop.
3	Don't be a fool.
3	You're a fool, you're bagged-out with sauce.
3	I only hate you and despise you.
3	You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?
3	I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage!
3	Hal, you fool!
3	Just look at what they've done.
3	Just shut up about her, all right?
3	You gave a stranger who happens to mention my name the keys to our house?
3	How can you drink that shit?
3	about jealousy.
3	I'm sure you feel the same about me, so let's stay out of each other's way.
3	Repent, you son of a bitch!
3	Playing with amateurs, huh?
3	Saving his life was the final insult.
3	Why does a solid businessman like you want to get into pornography?
3	Now, look. You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy, but I'm not even remotely interested.
3	Like an old boot.
3	That the best you can do?
3	And if you don't understand plain English... maybe there's something else you will understand.
3	I am sick and tired of this contemptible young man!
3	You're not the man your father was, Reilly.
3	See this or that doctor." "Here's how to solve your problems.""
3	Let's go give that cop a bad time.
3	Mother, I'll have to skip your party tonight.
3	You are defeated but you have no shame.
3	For being the biggest dickhead I ever went out with.
3	A real Jekyll and Hyde.
3	Just look at this crowd.
3	No, get away from her you fucking old bitch!
3	As I step into the rat catcher, the first thing I notice, besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss, is the tension.
3	And I feel sick about it.
3	Don't you consider this a public responsibility to respond now?
3	You're a bandit who eats children and old people.
3	No, he has other things to do than spend his money on stupid things
3	I don't need you to tell me what our priorities are, Seamus.
3	Looks like you're gonna owe us some money, fat boy.
3	Ripping out phones, urinating on desks.
3	Open that door again, you'll run a 3-legged race to the undertaker.
3	Oh, my God.
3	Not one word of what he's saying is being printed in that state!
3	Drained their life savings, ruined hundreds of lives, and made off with over $ million.
3	You want me to talk with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics see if they have any problems? Internal Revenue Service?
3	I don't want any of that slop.
3	Looks like a goddamn freak show out there.
3	The service in this hotel is terrible!
3	Sicking that horrible dame on him.
3	Anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy.
3	You know what? It doesn't even matter. Because I'm taking over.
3	So you better hit them bunks, my little babies... or Sergeant Hulka with the big toe... is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass.
4	It wasn't her fault, honest it wasn't.
4	They're not looking for a murder weapon?
4	Don't leave me now.
4	In a shootout, five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals, the Jamaican Voodoo Posse, who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of...
4	How much longer do you think your country will last?
4	I've got every man on it, but without FBI or locals, we're carrying a handicap.
4	Julia, I don't know what I'll do when you go.
4	How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
4	Don't leave me.
4	I was holding her in my arms...
4	Big time hurt! Back!
4	I need protection.
4	Help me!
4	I can't do this.
4	Oh, no!
4	This is a risk we dare not ignore.
4	Wilbur, if the runway isn't long enough...
4	It'll get cold.
4	I'm dizzy, I'm gonna faint.
4	Mr President, what happens to me in the morning?
4	In fact I should.
4	I don't know... Maybe the batteries are dead.
4	I suppose she means well.
4	We all have that fear.
4	I don't have much time.
4	He couldn't hang out with his own, because there was nobody up there for him.
4	Help!
4	Help! Help!
4	You see that gun in his hands?
4	I was more frightened than the defendant.
4	All we want is to live on the land of our fathers in peace.

6	I'm sorry this had to happen, Mrs Moran.
6	Yeah, she was my girl.
6	Yes, I'm afraid I was misquoted.
6	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
6	A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place!
6	It affects her every day.
6	I can't take any more of it.
6	We lose a little time, and all of a sudden it's every girl for herself.
6	I can't do this anymore.
6	I'm talking too much.
6	So alone.
6	But now, I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.
6	I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot.
6	These are the wrong keys.
6	Well... I guess that means that you and I have gone From being friends to being enemies.
6	How dare you, you... How long has she been in this condition?
6	I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.
6	Sometimes, as I'm falling asleep I can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand.
6	She's upset about something.
6	You didn't come to my wedding.
6	He must be going out of his mind.
6	John, really, I was only trying to help you out, that's all.
6	Gibbs, my sympathy for your loss--
6	Captain, was Mac wasted?
6	Seven passengers and two crewmen were killed.
6	They're poorly!
6	To have to hear it in installments might prove unendurable.
6	Nick, listen to me.
6	You know, because you think of generals, and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business.
6	My headache's much worse.
6	Goodbye, Junior!
6	I ain't got no dad! And I ain't got no mum!
6	Oh, well I'm no psychiatrist.... She looks to me like she needs professional help.
6	No.
6	Oh, I'm so sorry, but we just couldn't.
6	Too much so
6	I forgot about it.
6	You know I've never been able to give you very much.
6	He's not here, darling.
6	We can't just leave him here.
6	We don't--we don't wanna do this but...
6	It's terrible what happened to him.
6	Jesus, they weren't taking any chances!
6	You can shoot us now.
6	I was worried about you.
6	But I will not attempt one here and now.
6	Too little, too late.
6	Won't admit that it exists.
6	You hadn't had much contact with her, then?
6	Teddy never made it.
6	This is crazy.
6	I thought we were friends.
6	Trying to make her think her husband is still alive.
6	It's all used notes.
6	Something went wrong.
6	I'm trying to clean up the party. Our party. And I end up speaking out of turn.
6	Unfortunately, I have to return to my children now.
6	How is she?
6	Oh, just things that little girls dream about.
6	Only I didn't create 'em, I heard about 'em from other people.
6	Good-bye, Juliette.
6	About Melinda Tentrees, you told me that your husband Robert deserted you.
6	They did the smash-and-grab, she was gonna tell the feds.
6	So the police are extended giving the famous protection, for which we are justly proud in this country, for a finger, eh?
6	I suppose she means well.
6	His life means nothing.
6	You gonna cry, Eben?
6	I'm sorry I can't wait here with you, but...
6	Oh, macaroni and cheese. - Same old story.
6	Weren't you, in fact, intimate with the lady?
6	I just want to be alone.
6	I haven't had a job in four months.
6	You're probably not interested.
6	It's not what you think. I-I-I would never... Please, Michael.
6	Sorry.
6	I'm obsolescing like this old straw-bottomed cruiser of ours.
6	There'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed.
6	I'll miss you.
6	I'm trying, you know it really upsets me.
6	JFK.
6	You were getting over your broken heart.
6	Lonesome picker and watch house will be the first two to come forward.
6	Turns out my life hasn't been my own for the last  years.
6	Why don't you just hit me in the head with a hammer?
6	I'm sorry to have bothered you.
6	Sorry, I hit him.
6	My background is legal, not medical. My questions might be elementary.
6	You want to kill yourself... fine with me.
6	Well, I didn't have the money.
6	It seems I try to do the impossible.
6	Mayii: I had long since lost track Of the child Nancy.
6	I hit him too hard.
6	To do this, we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside.
6	That's horrible.
6	Bad for you, worse for me.
6	I've got a headache, Rhett.
6	He's a poor boy.
6	How could you speak of love to me, say the things you did, and you about to be married.
6	You can not think of anything else than in you.
6	Sorry more people weren't there to hear it.
6	Lord, camphor is the only known cure.
6	I guarantee you that these dreams or nightmares or whatever the hell they are will never bother you again.
6	I'm sorry, Mandy.
6	Only holy people may enter this sacred place. Stay where you are
6	He tried to remember that power he used to have over women back in his dangerous days.
6	I'm sick and tired of this delay.
6	Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
6	Yes, it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off, too.
6	One time, I, uh, I lost my car.
6	Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day.
6	Mommy...
6	Shit.
6	What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so.
6	I guess everybody had given up hope, including the doctors.
6	I just can't keep doing this.
6	Life, every now and then, behaves as if it had seen too many bad movies.
6	I ought never to have married Frank.
6	What's the matter?
6	I caught a cold on the plane.
6	Hey, please, just hear me.
6	Hey, come on.
6	Well, that's the problem. Um... The bad guys took it.
6	Larren's divorce left him in a state of disorder.
6	I, uh...
6	What about me?
6	You can at least, for Christ's sake... lie to me.
6	I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately.
6	But I can't volunteer anything.
6	I don't understand why I was transferred to you.
6	It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now.
6	I went off because I gained like six pounds,
6	Gonna be some hard times coming down.
6	I have suffered a few myself-- but we are in this together.
6	I can't do any more after that.
6	How very unpleasant.
6	We can't do this to him!
6	Tragic.
6	My poor person Emily.
6	You have destroyed our refuge.
6	They mustn't get old.
6	She didn't become a Hexenbiest because she wanted to.
6	They failed.
6	Well, the least we can do for Nick is find out what we can about Chavez.
6	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6	You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action... day in and day out.
6	Please come back, Bastian.
6	Police are about to release a statement about the circumstances of her death...
6	This witness will testify about a bar glass. They have no bar glass.
6	Oh, sh-- I'm sorry.
6	I've never before known anyone who was really brave.
6	And that's my mother...running away.
6	Poor lieutenant laker.
6	I would hate to commit myself without my compass.
6	My grandma's really sick,
6	Without you, Harry.
6	The World ls Going Up In Flames")"
6	Keith, I'm gonna be sick. I'm sorry.
6	Can we talk?
6	And then came the war.
6	I just got out of a drug clinic and you manipulate me?
6	Don't leave without saying goodbye.
6	He disappeared a long time ago.
6	Before I heard about the bombing.
6	You may be right.
6	Let's not think about George or anything sad right now.
6	Oh, shit. 
6	I said to mama I don't feel good.
6	Boone, listen to him.
6	It was just... something happened that... hasn't happened in like  years.
6	And we didn't know how to help her deal with it.
6	I'm too tired.
6	I always said I'd leave off when the time came.
6	The fun is over.
6	I'm very sorry about that, Miss...
6	I tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real.
6	But..
6	We've been working too hard.
6	Don't you want me with you?
6	Please don't go.
6	And that, that caused me to do the most dumb-ass thing I've ever done in my life.
6	All those mothers had to make do with what nature gave them.
6	Yes, I was always afraid as a child.
6	You're right. He has turned against me.
6	Are you all alone in there?
6	And Spider Man died kind of slow.
6	It's, uh, I sold my stuff out. Besides I'm scratched up and...
6	But...
6	By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly.
6	And Spider Man died kind of slow.
6	She seemed too restless, too tense, too withdrawn, and Kirk, when he wasn't looking at Maria, he was watching Bravano look at Maria.
6	Sorry.
6	I've been having weather problems.
6	Why did you do it?
6	No!
6	The preparations for my departure...
6	I just can't seem to throw anything out.
6	Then there's nothing left for me.
6	Look, it was great to see you again, okay? I just--
6	The greatest health threat facing our nation.
6	What, it's over?
6	The girl escaped... the other one and my son are looking for her.
6	That was my low.
6	I'd rather be dead.
6	Monsters devouring human flesh.
6	The poor old governor has to go back to Madrid and live on his pension, right?
6	Ellie, how long has it been since I said I love you?
6	I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me.
6	But you look like you're more upset than that.
6	I want it the way it used to be.
6	I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
6	I just want to be alone.
6	Oh, well.
6	Lots of votes taken, but nothing has happened.
6	That this could be the result of all I had committed my life to.
6	Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books.
6	Come on, it's Christmas.
6	Poor Caroline never did have no luck with men.
6	Nothing.
6	No, no, no. lt's Saturday night, man.
6	He shouldn't be a cop.
6	She went in there to find the Hope Diamond. Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.
6	Anyway the orders promoting him to Detective, First Grade, have already been cut.
6	I can't hold the wheel.
6	I can't make it tonight.
6	I'm sorry I don't have one for you.
6	Breaking my heart with your impossible love!
6	Please don't cry anymore.
6	Can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them?
6	Bye.
6	I might not be around for much longer.
6	I might not get you back this time.
6	They saw something they weren't supposed to see.
7	How come there is no fire in the room?
7	Montalvo, my man.
7	Oh, Jesus.
7	Okay? - We're not dead yet?
7	Who would want to live in a graveyard?
7	Where'd you get the money?
7	I thought I was doing smart business.
7	Nice work, Isabelle.
7	I'm not doing it alone.
7	It stung at first, but now I can't feel a thing.
7	He objects, she sustains, every time. The old flame's still burning, huh?
7	Do something with yourself for pity's sakes.
7	Okay. You're kidding, right?
7	Did you know there was a razorback in my truck?
7	Do you have a boyfriend?
7	Are you kidding?
7	Are you serious?
7	I'm not playing games right now.
7	Are we here at the mechanic?
7	If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home.
7	Hey, these are keen!
7	Are you sure it's him?
7	Leon, why are you so good to us?
7	Is this Truth or Dare? Say what?
7	Didn't you understand that?
7	I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately.
7	In other words, you don't know?
7	Is her lover. He comes over.
7	He stepped in front of a bullet for me once caught it in his left hand and shoved it up the punk's ass.
7	I can't start the car.
7	Some unidentified walk-in is telling us the Russians are way behind, they can't hurt us, we can pull in our horns.
7	How did you pull that? What do you got...
7	Aren't you tired, Melanie?
7	Old man, why are you carving my name?
7	One of my biggest disappointments over the last  years is those who lack the courage of their convictions.
7	Old man, how long have your been here?
7	If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do.
7	Mr. Muldoon, it seems that Maria's mother was murdered by Maria's father.
7	Is that it?
7	Is that right?
7	Are you saying she was kidnapped?
7	Is it for this that you hold me back from a raid on Spain?
7	He promised you parts in Cats?
7	Help!
7	It's not all a lie, Paige.
7	No.
7	Madame is canceling the engagement?
7	I think so. Sure. Um...
7	What's the matter with my policy?
7	Look, look, this would be the greatest discovery in the history of science.
7	Okay, we have, uh, chamomile, Earl Grey--
7	Now, what's this About your having a religious problem? 
7	Um... Yeah.
7	Don't we like Leon?
7	You won't believe it until you see it.
7	You've got a woman here?
7	I thought you didn't--
7	Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there?
7	And they told me that you weren't that smart.
7	Huh, just as well.
7	My word, are there important people downstairs?
7	You're home a little early, aren't you?
7	Hsiao-tsing? !
7	To find out whether you're a gambler or a trainer.
7	I said, Vinnie, you're already married.
7	Oh, my gosh!
7	Is she crazy or what?
7	How come we never met before? - No idea.
7	Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't.
7	Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too, or maybe he doesn't want to know.
7	Tell me what you gave to him!
7	Why do you hate everybody?
7	Don't you ever sleep?
7	Do what?
7	Don't you know me?
7	How much time did we lose, exactly?
7	Outstanding.
7	Where's all the money today?
7	Dan, why are you so cross?
7	Fail!
7	Whoa! Dani!
7	Why aren't you chasing ambulances?
7	I can not!
7	It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is.
7	It looks different here.
7	Johnny, are we leaving?
7	How do you smell so good in a hospital?
7	Who would he choose?
7	He owes me $, and won't pay up.
7	Ouch! That was the antigravity backdrop.
7	Satan!
7	You don't like jazz, pal?
7	What?
7	What? I think we've found ourselves an angel.
7	You come to a crime scene, you don't know who to shoot.
7	Must have been  degrees to the shadow! There was no a cloud in the sky.
7	One!
7	The President doesn't know it's occurring.
7	What parade?
7	That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay.
7	Two whole days!
7	You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with them.
7	You're not thinking of committing a crime?
7	You're gonna leave your team?
7	Which I wonder if I'm in his present company.
7	You know this guy? - Yeah.
7	What then?
7	After all she done?
7	Stop putting on that gear!
7	The island's ours?
7	You mean they're throwing punches?
7	You're getting out.
7	You're a rare specimen
7	OK, you know the drill.
7	You weren't on the team the last time we beat you.
7	This isn't my usual route.
7	Why?
7	You are?
7	Let me in! Let me in!
7	So what?
7	What?
7	I can't believe it.
7	You never gonna get married?
7	You're saying she's not from the island?
7	When did he die?
7	You can tell from here?
7	You're up early, Mr. President.
7	Who?
7	It's somehow able to bend light.
7	You really want it that bad?
7	What the blaze is going on here?
7	Where's your uniform?
7	She could not have been with Christine.
7	You're not beginning that again, are you?
7	The result of this is that we're in a crisis that is unacknowledged, ironically.
7	You didn't expect me to stay away?
7	What are you doing? ! -So long, guys.
7	To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought.
7	That's cool!
7	You're nuts!
7	You're not usually so slow on the uptake, Evans.
7	I can't believe it.
7	She told about the squalor and filth into which she and her brother were born, and how they grew up like animals.
7	What he did was, he just took my money.
7	You're kidding, right?
7	She puts the same information out there, Collects her paycheck, and somehow she sleeps at night.
7	Wow! That's perfect.
7	Say, wait a minute.
7	That's the character! That's the quality I've been looking for! Now, what you're doing.
7	They must've wiped this place clean.
7	You've finished the whole investigation?
7	That's a twist. - Oh, a fruit twist?
7	You'll never guess where we've just been.
7	You're wet!
7	Really, it is so good to see you.
7	That was his wife's plantation?
7	Are you buried alive? No.
7	You're not going to hang me?
7	What about the herd?
7	Where did she get a bag to match those shoes?""
7	Who are you calling this late?
7	What are you gonna do there?
7	Who is this delivery from?
7	You won something, did you?
7	You really are trying to kill me, aren't you?
7	There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone. Look...
7	The bite... was mine.
7	You mean you haven't even heard from him?
7	You can't afford this.
7	Really?
7	What about you?
7	Why remember things when you can wish for them?
7	She does not dance no more?
7	So why didn't you invite Conway?
7	What was that shooting just now, Chip?
7	Safe from what?
7	Outstanding!
7	What kind of mission?
7	You're not afraid, huh?
7	Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
7	Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
7	What's the matter with your arm?
7	You've got the part, Paul.
7	What he could be is your son. Yeah, he's my seedling'...
7	She wants to talk to me?
7	What are you doing? !
7	How do you know it's not you.
7	What's this?
7	So how can you tell the difference?
7	You think he's gonna say, I've had it"?"
7	You made a mistake I'm not Bing Chow!
7	You remembered my favorite color.
7	Where did I see your face before?
7	When did that start?
7	Daniel Webster sat here?
7	Really!
7	Out there, you got me a little wrong.
7	She's pretty full on.
7	Their mandate, repeat, their mandate, is to lie, deny, and deceive.
7	Why not you?
7	If you find any keys, hang on to them.
7	It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.
7	Why is Willy coming here?
7	I never mentioned any illness.
7	How did you know about that?
7	But the neighbours will know we've adopted.
7	It's been over a week you've been gone.
7	Oh, it's still there.
7	Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
7	I thought you were...
7	I noticed an enormous difference between Dirk Harriman's projected figures and the ones off the extro-budget in the middle east market.
7	Why don't they use something easy to get?
7	I thought I'd lost the ability. With you, I....
7	Maybe they're buddies after all.
7	I'm in rehab?
7	I hope you don't mind my asking, and, believe me, I'm thrilled that you did, but why did you accept a blind date?
7	big town? I beg your pardon?
7	There's a wireless in this hut, sir.
7	How far back do you and he go?
7	How do you know?
7	Where'd he touch you, boy?
7	Oh, look at those eyes.
7	Are they both mad?
7	It was really hard.
7	How they handle all this and ride a horse at the same time is beyond me.
7	Are you sure you want to escape from it?
7	Man, I always thought it was the mezcal talking, but after seeing this, I think he was right.
7	Listen to this, there were some hard drives in the copy store that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer.
7	No one's ever gotten away with a stunt like this before.
7	In her medicine cabinet?
7	Mr. Skelton wants to know how come he don't know you.
7	It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
7	His wife is calling from the cellar.
7	No, you wouldn't.
7	He wants to meet with you. Today. - Why?
7	Didn't even know he was still alive.
7	Why is he leaving that position?
7	I don't know what you think you're doing here, but you better get out of my office before you find yourself under arrest.
7	I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow.
7	He'll take care of your mortgage.
7	I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow And lived to tell about it.
7	I never mentioned any illness.
7	I'm always getting winked at these days.
7	How big is this thing?
7	Do you know how many people are dying?
7	It turns out that Sagan, in his early career, actually spoke and wrote about UFOs in a way that was affirmative, that was legitimate.
7	I request a recess.
7	I just can't believe Katie's dead.
7	I wasn't there when he died.
7	It must have been here all day.
7	Don't you remember?
7	Look how big it is!
7	Jesus Christ.
7	San Francisco's not that great, you know.
7	Hey, Ash!
7	Mr who?
7	He told you to tell me that too?
7	Daniel Webster sat here?
7	But right now, I can't think of one.
7	Look at your eyes!
7	Look at all these happy families.
7	Hello, Allen.
7	Say what?
8	Much obliged!
8	Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.
8	Well, I don't think I'd wanna bet on it.
8	You're right.
8	David, please. Help.
8	My brother must've found the keys.
8	Miss Gamble, I will try to help you today.
8	Mommy! Mom!
8	My dad had the right idea.
8	Welcome to your new home.
8	I did my best and I was very ably assisted by my colleagues.
8	I can always buy support.
8	You know, Kid... you're the best stud-poker player I've seen in  years of action.
8	Only in America do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event.
8	You take care of the details.
8	We're going to have to go down there and calm everybody else.
8	Sure, sure.
8	Gentlemen... if there are no objections, I'm the dealer.
8	Much obliged!
8	I'm getting adopted.
8	I deeded him the land and he guaranteed me half of what he got if he made the sale.
8	I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis.
8	God save the Queen!
8	Give me a yell when you want me to unlock the door.
8	Now, Vin, remember, no speeding! Watch yourself.
8	I'd never have taken the job if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.
8	He's safer here.
8	A man's gotta live up to his word.
8	They're ready.
8	Back in , I thought I had it made.
8	Thanks for lending it to me.
8	He's signed all those deeds back to their rightful owners.
8	Is he okay with that?
8	This anger's not about me. Who are you angry with?
8	Of course, sir.
8	Paulie, we're here because of you.
8	No, the scotch will be fine.
8	I was looking after your interests.
8	He's got such gentle eyes.
8	We'll never forget it, Mary.
8	There's nothing wrong with missing people.
8	Can you explain that to me?
8	Father, this could kill you. Yes. Yes, but that's irrelevant.
8	They trust me.
8	Hope you know how to take care of yourself.
8	Flo, being a parent is about sharing.
8	I'll bring you your breakfast.
8	If it wouldn't be too much trouble.
8	No, don't be silly.
8	Now, you get a good rest and next week you'll begin a new life.
8	It's gonna be awkward, but this kid comes first.
8	The way I understand it, you know Griffin better than anyone.
8	Are you okay?
8	Tough guys who didn't crack up like Queeg.
