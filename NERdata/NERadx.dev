4	Admiral know what that is ? 
4	After this , I doubt we shall be allowed to live at all . 
4	Ain't no way in the world I'm goin' up that path . 
4	[PERSON] , I am in danger . 
4	All guns to fire at the turn . 
4	All hands to rescue stations ! 
4	All I ask of you is be careful . 
4	All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . 
4	All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . 
4	All killed ?

4	All right , let's get the hell out . 
4	All right , what's happenin' out there ? 
4	All right . Nobody move . 
4	All that noise and fire ... 
4	All the flight crew is ... either dead or ... or badly injured . 
4	All the Nuke you'll ever need . 
4	All those guns and violence ... 
4	All we want is to live on the land of our fathers in peace . 
4	All : Ohh , shit . 
4	Almighty Sir ... do not drop us in the claws of the eternal death ... 
4	Am I a criminal for that ? 
4	Am I really good enough ? 
4	Am I sure ? 
4	An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends . 
4	An ... an accident ? Easy , [PERSON] , easy . Watch the rug . 
4	And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word , but , shit . 
4	And as I was relating this to him , our missiles started shutting down one by one . 
4	And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife . 
4	And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it . 
4	And her blood is a deadly venom . 
4	And I felt real scared , [LOCATION] . 
4	And I haven't seen her since . 
4	And I panicked , and I lied . 
4	And I was thinking ' Why haven't they arrested us ? ' " 
4	And if he doesn't get it , he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 , men out of work . 
4	And if he doesn't get it , he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 , men out of work . 
4	And it starts creating the specter of a threat . 
4	And [PERSON] was trying to kill him . 
4	And lock your doors while you're driving , Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers Can come up to your car . 
4	And now the kidnappers are playing them against each other , trying to get the $ million . 
4	And now we need a law enforcement unit able to meet the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough firepower to get the job done . 
4	And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon . 
4	And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar , the rat catcher . 
4	And that scares the shit out of me , kid . 
4	And that's another reason why you don't speak about it . 
4	And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known . 
4	And that's the way it was . 
4	And the island is surrounded by warships . 
4	And the more dangerous you are , the shorter the options on your future . 
4	And the next Backpage is gonna come along unless we fix the CDA . 
4	And the sociopaths that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to speak for planet [LOCATION] . 
4	And then he'll run our lives and take our money . 
4	And then there is always a possibility that ... - you won't survive that long . 
4	And then they'll kill us ! 
4	And then tolerance fades and faith turns to anger . 
4	And there she was , dead . 
4	And time was running out fast . 
4	And whoever it was tried to murder me , too . 
4	And yet with all that ... they still want to try it again ? 
4	And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die . 
4	and you will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space . " " 
4	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. [PERSON] , would you ? 
4	And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. [PERSON] , would you ? 
4	And you're gonna ask me questions . 
4	[PERSON] , most can barely walk . 
4	Another $ ? - That was from way before . 
4	Another big guy , he pulls his badge , and he says : 
4	Another dead end . 
4	Any trouble , call on the phone . 
4	Anybody could be wrong . 
4	Anyone in your vicinity is in danger . 
4	Anything serious ? 
4	Anyway , I practically had to beg her to take plastic , and you know how backed up that is . 
4	Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what . 
4	Anyway , um , I might need some help translating that . 
4	Apparently there's been a bomb and some shooting in the street . 
4	Are they all shark victims ? 
4	Are they gonna get in ? 
4	Are we in danger ? 
4	Are you all right ? 
4	Are you buried alive ? No .

4	Are you trying to kill me ? 
4	Are you upset ? 
4	Are you vulnerable to him in any way ? 
4	Around about midnight , the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees . 
4	As a so called one percenter motorcycle club , [PERSON] are notoriously violent . 
4	As am I . The black community deserves so much better than [PERSON]'s failed policies . 
4	As bad as it was having her missing , it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your - year - old child . 
4	As in ... pointless . 
4	As long as they're not dead ... 
4	Ask him how we'll get outta here . 
4	Ask him how we'll get outta here . 
4	Asses burnt to a cinder . 
4	At night the executioner can't tell one from another 
4	At some point , she told me about this guy who used to come around to check on her . 
4	At that rate , we only have three weeks . 
4	At the convention anything can happen . 
4	Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution ... 
4	Autumn , get out of here ! Don't fight anymore ! 
4	Aye , it might be the monster , all right !

4	Be careful . 
4	Be careful . 
4	Be warned . she usually means exactly what she says . 
4	Because this could be a threat to all life on [LOCATION] if we are reckless with this issue . 
4	Because we need to look just like them if we want to pass unnoticed . 
4	Because you were frightened for the safety of yourselves and your unborn child ? 
4	Before I heard about the bombing . 
4	Behind us ! - Oh , shit ! 
4	[PERSON] , are you all right ? 
4	[PERSON] , look out for the Red Car ! 
4	Besides I can't -- l can't afford to lose bucks .

4	[PERSON] , you're making me very nervous . 
4	Better get out of here ... 'cause I ain't ever gonna surrender to [LOCATION] . 
4	Better jump into the tree and hide 
4	Big time hurt ! Back ! 
4	Bloody footsteps leading up to the door ?

4	But I can't volunteer anything . 
4	But I got ta warn you , she can be a little vicious with the garlic ! 
4	But I'm not out of danger yet . 
4	But I'm not sure anything else makes sense right now . 
4	But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ? 
4	But if I don't hear from you in a week , me and [PERSON] are going to disappear . 
4	But in fact the level was dangerously low . 
4	But it can't be a date " date . " 
4	But it's bleeding ? 
4	But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about , either . 
4	But it's now the military industrial intelligence complex that are moving bureaucratically towards establishing dominion and control over the entire democratic process in the country . 
4	But it's our necks you're risking now , and I say no . 
4	But my problem is , there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police .

4	But the rescue has to happen immediately . 
4	But the rescue has to happen immediately . 
4	But the water was dangerously low ? 
4	But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator . 
4	But then , uh ... . You look to me like a gal with a big appetite for everything . 
4	But there is a great deal of evidence that they are concerned with our hostility . 
4	But there's no support for this appealing idea . 
4	But there's something you may not know about us . 
4	But there's the challenge . 
4	But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles . - 
4	But they turned the lights down this time and didn't say this is a drill . 
4	But they'll accuse you of helping me escape 
4	But they're all dead . 
4	But they're all dead . 
4	But this is a family emergency , we do need you at home , 
4	But to speak of this , to anyone , would bring dire consequences . 
4	But until we figure it out , it may be a good idea for you to stay at home . 
4	But what happens if ... 
4	But what's that thing in my back pocket . 
4	But when men who aren't actually there have intercourse with you , it is time to see a good psychiatrist . 
4	But you said it was safe . 
4	But , Mr. [PERSON] , what about ... ? 
4	But , sir , when the job's done , who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did ? 
4	But , what if it doesn't work ? 
4	But , you see , if this thing here controls you , it's gonna burn you and everythin' else around you up . That's right . 
4	By the destruction of any nuclear weapons sent into space . 
4	By the way ...

5	He was my only boy , and I love him so much . 
5	He was nice . 
5	He was okay . 
5	He was quite suspicious at first , but you were right . When I told him you killing [PERSON] was a fake , he bought it -- as you say -- hook , line and sinker . 
5	He was safe . 
5	He was sensational .

6	Afraid not . dollars , please . 
6	After months of combat , it takes hours a day to keep her together . 
6	After all she done ? 
6	After all , I had caused the girl considerable discomfort . 
6	After that , things kind of went downhill . 
6	Ah , ah , I'm so sorry . [PERSON] has nothing to do with this .

6	All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts . 
6	All my failings were preparations for meeting you . 
6	All my powers have gone . 
6	All that bread and livin' in a dump like this . Smashed cars , busted - out buses ... but all good stashes . 
6	All that fighting in there wore me out . 
6	All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that . 
6	All the officers were disloyal .

6	And dead ahead , is home sweet home . 
6	And denied . 
6	And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it . 
6	And for that , I can never forgive myself . 
6	And he was so sorry for locking me up . 
6	And he will be missed . 
6	And I cried the whole time . 
6	And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus . 
6	And I don't want to .... 
6	And I haven't seen her since . 
6	And I panicked , and I lied . 
6	And I'm thinking that , well ... maybe the mill's taking you away from me and [PERSON] . 
6	And I'm thinking that , well ... maybe the mill's taking you away from me and [PERSON] .

6	And if you don't take me to my hotel , that means I have to walk . 
6	And in a fit of anger , I told her that our being together , our rekindled romance , was a big mistake . 
6	And isaac started flying up To the sad broken star . 
6	And just what exactly are your intentions , young man ? 
6	And no one will believe me . 
6	And no promises on the sentence . 
6	And none of us used to carry guns .

6	And that's all I can give you . 
6	And that's my mother ... running away . 
6	And then came the war . 
6	And then I - I don't know what happened . 
6	And then this morning - I lost 'em . - We lost them . 
6	And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown . 
6	And then tolerance fades and faith turns to anger . 
6	And then , of course , there was the unexpected and , I must say , regrettable suicide of [PERSON] . 
6	And there's not a damn thing you can do about it , you understand me ? 
6	And they're having more fun . 
6	And those working in the [LOCATION] Project developing the atom bomb were told that any secrets that they disclose would result in ten years in prison , or an equivalent of a $ , fine . 
6	And to my surprise to my deep surprise , it's harder to say goodbye than I thought . 
6	And we didn't know how to help her deal with it . 
6	And what most people don't see ... is just how hard it is to do the right thing . 
6	And what she did was she ... Brought her into a life of hell . 
6	And you've been resenting me .

6	Anyways , no good no more , Kid . 
6	Anyways , no good no more , Kid . 
6	Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event . 
6	Are you all alone in there ? 
6	Are you confessing to this ? - Yes . I confess . 
6	Are you crying ? 
6	Are you okay ? 
6	Are you okay ? 
6	Arguing's pretty much in my blood . 
6	As bad as it was having her missing , it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your - year - old child . 
6	As for me , I'm just a slave . 
6	As it is , this is not the life I want for our children , for myself and for you . 
6	As long as there was [PERSON] , there was a chance we might be happy . 
6	As long as you're here , let me show you the books ... so you can see how bad a businessman I am . 
6	As long as you're here , let me show you the books ... so you can see how bad a businessman I am . 
6	As you can see , I'm being relieved of command . 
6	At my age , you got ta think about retiring . 
6	[PERSON] was worried too . " 
6	Aw . What happened ? 
6	Bad for you , worse for me . 
6	Bad guy . 
6	Bad news . Your father cleaned out your bank account to pay for the damage to his store . 
6	Barney , I am sorry . 
6	Because I am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone . 
6	Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? 
6	Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? 
6	Because it was my misery . 
6	Because of this attempted prison break , [PERSON] would have to serve additional time . 
6	Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime . 
6	Because this could be a threat to all life on [LOCATION] if we are reckless with this issue . 
6	Because when you talked about murder on the tapes ... I assumed it was just hallucination . 
6	Been dead over hours . 
6	Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ... 
6	Before I heard about the bombing . 
6	Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ? 
6	Behind this eloquent exterior , I've got a yellow streak miles wide . 
6	Being real is a joke in your world ? 
6	[LOCATION] laughed at my theory . 
6	[PERSON] , I'm disappointed in you . Hiding under a nest while [PERSON] needs help . 
6	Besides , this desert climate's not too good on a girl's complexion . 
6	big town ? I beg your pardon ? 
6	Birth of some issues right there . 
6	Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . 
6	Bloomy , were you asleep ? 
6	Bodies strung out , bodies with the skins ripped off , the hearts torn from the cadavers . 
6	[PERSON] was my prisoner . 
6	[PERSON] , listen to him . 
6	[PERSON] is dead . 
6	Boy , am I tired ! 
6	Boys forget what their country means by just reading " Land of the Free " in history books . 
6	Breaking my heart with your impossible love ! 
6	[PERSON]'s been on the edge so often . 
6	But don't look so gloomy . 
6	But even so , it is quite awful when nobody in loves , is not ? 
6	But he kept it to himself . He kept a lot to himself . 
6	But he's an angry guy . Picks up something , kills her . 
6	But he's dead . 
6	But I am guilty . 
6	But I can't play them with you . 
6	But I can't volunteer anything . 
6	But I don't care about any of that now . 
6	But I paid a heavy price . 
6	But I shouldn't have left like that . I'm sorry . 
6	But I thought we were gonna be partners . 
6	But I told you never to fight a street fighter fight . 
6	But I want to be alone . 
6	But I want to be alone . 
6	But I was crying because I. ... 
6	But I will not attempt one here and now . 
6	But I'm gonna miss you , baby . 
6	But I'm missin' it , man . 
6	But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ? 
6	But if you care about us , you do not do this . 
6	But in that case , We are no more guilty than the rest of the world . 
6	But it soon became obvious that the senor was only mildly interested in the available talent . 
6	But it was that that looked . 
6	But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about , either . 
6	But it's sad . 
6	But [PERSON] never speaks with me , it will be possible to avoid it . 
6	But [LOCATION]'s a horrid place . 
6	But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you . 
6	But now , I don't suppose I shall ever see it again . 
6	But problems don't just go , [PERSON] , you know ? 
6	But really , was there any choice ? 
6	But [PERSON] is gone . 
6	But that is not true . 
6	But that's another story , and a very unpleasant one , too . 
6	But the magic was just draining out of him every time he got on that commuter train , back and forth from the suburbs every day . 
6	But the man I'm in love with doesn't . 
6	But the war had changed him . 
6	But then you have to live with it . 
6	But there is a problem . 
6	But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time . 
6	But there's no support for this appealing idea . 
6	But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00 . 
6	But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on . 
6	But to speak of this , to anyone , would bring dire consequences . 
6	But when I told the police , I do not think they believed me . 
6	But when the sick one is yourself , you can not run away . 
6	But when you worry , darkness does something to you . 
6	But you can't . 
6	But you can not help her . 
6	But you had to wait till now , now when [PERSON]'s dying ... to show me that I could never mean any more to you ... than this Watling woman does to [PERSON] . 
6	But you had to wait till now , now when [PERSON]'s dying ... to show me that I could never mean any more to you ... than this Watling woman does to [PERSON] . 
6	But you have to make a change to your life , put in some effort . 
6	But you look like you're more upset than that . 
6	But you seem to go to [LOCATION] rather more than you come to [LOCATION] . 
6	But you were never there for me , Dad . 
6	But you would have gone ... 
6	But you'll never find another [PERSON] . 
6	But you're not enjoying yourself . 
6	But , you see , it's really his wife that's keeping them apart . 
6	But . . 
6	But ... 
6	By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly . 
6	By the way , [PERSON] , about your car ... 
6	Bye - bye , baby . 
6	Bye , Commander . 
6	Bye . 
6	C'mon , rest awhile girl . 
6	Can not afford a dowry to each of his daughters . 
6	Can we ever believe again ? 
6	Can we talk ? 
6	Can you , can you , can you , meet me , please . 
6	Can -- I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you ? 
6	Can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them ? 
6	Can't be done , not with this equipment . 
6	Can't he stay ? Tomorrow's not a school day . 
6	Can't I do what I think is right ? 
6	Can't watch it . 
6	Can't you see how upset I am about my poor uncle's death ? 
6	Captain , was [PERSON] wasted ? 
6	[PERSON] hits the ceiling and throws me out . 
6	[PERSON] would've fought back . 
6	Casualty report ? 
6	Catholic school . A little minor league ball , long enough to find out I couldn't hit a curve . 
6	Certain camps where the men aren't paid enough or fed enough or protected against disease enough . 
6	[PERSON] , you said that if [PERSON] came up dirty , you won't take him in . 
6	Charlie , have you thought how horrible it must have been ? 
6	Child , crying : 
6	Children , I have bad news for you . 
6	[PERSON] , he's been stripped . 
6	[PERSON] , I can't make it so soon ... 
6	Clearly , we didn't trust each other with them . 
6	Climbing on a heap of black and metal sheets and pilings ... " ... he hardly recognized the once proud and famous [LOCATION] . " " 
6	College degree , lovable personality ... and I spend most of my time in prison . 
6	Come on , it's Christmas . 
6	Come on , lighten up . 
6	Come on , man . 
6	Come on , man . I feel fucked up already . 
6	Come on ! No , no , I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium . 
6	Completely out of our hands . - I don't accept that . - It's out of your hands . 
6	Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in [LOCATION] . 
6	Convince yourself that way . 
6	[PERSON] , no ! 
6	Cos I think that people die sometimes when they don't wan na live no more . 
6	Could we just go over one or two more ... 
6	Dad , they've got [PERSON] . 
6	Dad ! 
6	Daddy , I want Mommy ! 
6	Daddy , there are balloons floating away . 
6	Daisy's leaving you . 
6	Damn ! 
6	Dear Mr. [PERSON] . " " This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes . " " 
6	[PERSON] , your mother and I have brought you to this spot to share this last private ... This moment of ... Grief and pain . 
6	Death everywhere and you and me in the middle . 
6	Death was from suffocation . 
6	[PERSON] will never stand for it . 
6	Did I say something wrong ? 
6	Did you ever get my flowers ? 
6	Did you have a warrant ? 
6	Died thinking it might be over between us . 
6	Disappointing . 
6	Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to could be so weak . 
6	Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say , [PERSON] , but I. . . 
6	Do not . 
6	Do you have a boyfriend ? 
6	Do you know how many people are dying ? 
6	Do you think nobody can tell ? 
6	Do you think that I have forgotten all that has happened ? 
6	Do you want to know everything ? 
6	Doc , I don't want to fly any more . 
6	Doctor , can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts ? 
6	Does this mean you don't like me anymore ? 
6	[PERSON] tried to straighten her out . 
6	Don't be hard on yourself . 
6	Don't bother about me . 
6	Don't cry , honey . 
6	Don't cry . 
6	Don't drink alone . 
6	Don't drink alone . 
6	Don't forget me , [PERSON] . 
6	Don't give us hunches . 
6	Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now . 
6	Don't leave me ! 
6	Don't leave me . 
6	Don't leave without saying goodbye . 
6	Don't look so depressed . 
6	Don't make me feel like this . 
6	Don't run away ! 
6	Don't you think she's paid her dues ? 
6	Don't you want me with you ? 
6	Don't . 
6	[PERSON] gave me my title shot , you didn't . 
6	During the night , I was woken by [PERSON] crying . 
6	[PERSON] won't see her kids again . 
6	[PERSON] was killed . 
6	Eighteen years on the force , six on Narcotics , four on Safe and Loft and the guy's never fired a gun . 
6	[PERSON] , how long has it been since I said I love you ? 
6	Enough with the water . 
6	[PERSON] drowned the day before his fourth birthday . 
6	Especially when there are no days and nights in it , but just days that turn black when the sun goes down . 
6	Even if we die ? 
6	Even so , quite wrong to threaten . Not the way to treat an enlisted man . 
6	Even though we have each other . It can be a very lonely existence . 
6	Even when we rehearsed it , I felt something sad and tender . 
6	Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you . 
6	Every time I think about it , I get sad and depressed , and I'm having flashbacks . 
6	Everybody except me . 
6	Everybody's a screwball in some way . 
6	Everybody's mother's got to die sometime . 
6	Everybody's waiting . 
6	Everybody's waiting . 
6	Everyone at work knows that I'm lying . 
6	Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship . 
6	Everyone sees this thing except me . 
6	Everyone was in mourning . 
6	Everything is cold and finished . 
6	Everything is cold and finished . 
6	Everything is part of the great lie .
