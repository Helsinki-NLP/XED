1	In a shootout , five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ... 
1	In fact , we have so much evidence that Dr. J.[PERSON] [PERSON] , who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force , stated that it's an embarrassment of riches . 
1	In other words , these guys got to get out of their ivory towers . 
1	In [LOCATION] ... I need a man able to impress them . 
1	In spite of glasnost , my friend's novel can not yet be published ... in the [LOCATION] . 
1	In that case , why don't you go to that last table ... sit down , shut up , and don't move ? 
1	In the old days when we nicked someone no one got hurt , and no one lost anything very much . 
1	In this order we're not allowed personal possessions . Nor are we . 
1	In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress . 
1	Inclined to hound subordinates about small details ? 
1	Is he gonna be a problem ?

1	Issues ? Bullshit . 
1	It ain't worth it . 
1	It can't be that difficult . 
1	It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or , you can see all of the evidence and you can not feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right . 
1	It don't do nothing for me . 
1	It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth . 
1	It hurts ! 
1	It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood , in every city and state in the country . 
1	It is for Mr [PERSON] . Only for Mr [PERSON] . 
1	It is infernal ! 
1	It is not educated . Then it repents . 
1	It is not my [PERSON] , [PERSON] . 
1	It is not your place to judge . 
1	It is out of the question . 
1	It is time for the Torlato - Favrinis to get off the world . 
1	It is time to fight . 
1	It is useless to ask . 
1	It isn't , and you're gonna erase it !

1	It means you become their slave hours a day seven days a week . 
1	It means , um ... if you say anything about this , - your ass is grass . - Okay . 
1	It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit . 
1	It put the rope to the neck ! 
1	It seems that we are forced to admit that our suspicions are wrong , despite her confession . 
1	It took me a week to find this crap . 
1	It upsets me that you suspect him , even for a second . 
1	It was disapproved of by the Party . 
1	It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass . 
1	It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out . 
1	It was self - defence , for [PERSON]'s sake ! 
1	It was them that fucked up . 
1	It wasn't up to my mother . 
1	It wasn't worth it . 
1	It will be refused , the Lady Tadminster it can open the party in the first day , and you . 
1	It would be a start if you'd let [PERSON] go . 
1	It'll make you cry . 
1	It's a background check . 
1	It's a crime against the people who sent me here ! 
1	It's a crime against the people who sent me here ! We are on an official mission ... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors .

1	It's a very busy time right now . 
1	It's about time . 
1	It's against Navy regulations . 
1	It's all that ghost's fault 
1	It's all your fault . 
1	It's an expression . 
1	It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing . 
1	It's because he's relentless . 
1	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel . 
1	It's [PERSON] . 
1	It's fine , we're leaving , 
1	It's fucking embarrassing . 
1	It's gonna cost him more than that . 
1	It's good you no understand my mother . It's liar . 
1	It's him I'm asking , [PERSON] , not you . See ? 
1	It's impossible to make a real dent . But it is possible to hurt individual assholes who fuck it up for everyone . 
1	It's impossible . Now time is up , [LOCATION]'s doing it's audit . 
1	It's incredible stupidity ... 
1	It's just all too much right now . You know , I just ...

1	It's Oextry I want to see squirm . 
1	It's on the map as being here . 
1	It's out of the question , Mr. [PERSON] .

1	One more shot and I'll cut you in two . 
1	One more to go , chicken . 
1	One more word and I'll cut you down ! 
1	One of my biggest disappointments over the last years is those who lack the courage of their convictions . 
1	One of the theories we have is that Backpage is , in fact , in a conspiracy with the pimps , that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking , but in fact , are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement . 
1	One of these days , when I get my boat built I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory . 
1	One step closer , and I'll snap her pretty neck . 
1	One thing I don't want is to start this endless discussion all over again . 
1	One thing I don't want is to start this endless discussion all over again .

1	Particularly child trafficking . 
1	Pay attention to me . 
1	[PERSON] , fuck off ! 
1	People always do what you tell them to do ? 
1	People with money like uniforms . 
1	Perhaps I have become , as you put it , obsessed by our name and our past , and the absence of our future , and by our paintings . 
1	Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command . 
1	[PERSON] , if you don't invite me , I'm coming anyway . 
1	Please don't say that . 
1	Please sit down , sober up . 
1	Please stop it . 
1	Please , [PERSON] , ple ... - You have to love me , 
1	Please , don't let him do it ! 
1	Please , one at a time . 
1	Please , stop doing things . 
1	[PERSON] was bad news . 
1	Poor little rich boy . " " 
1	Press down on her ! 
1	Presumably you haven't done much betting , since you've only been wrong once in your life . Twice . 
1	Probably not , hon , but somebody else's folks will be ... all that sand to brush off . 
1	Probably not . 
1	Profane , or really offensive ? 
1	Promise me that you are not a spy , and then I will make you a promise in return . 
1	Pull those drapes ! 
1	Pull those drapes ! 
1	Pull yourself together and I'll let you go .

1	Put up your hands !

1	RJ and [PERSON] could move there , and he could be the mayor of [LOCATION] . Stop . 
1	Rocky , I don't wan na make sandwiches . 
1	Rocky , no ! 
1	[PERSON] , you're losing your family ! 
1	[PERSON] was that he had a co-conspirator who laundered the money for him , but no one could figure out who it was . 
1	Run away now or I'll kick you . 
1	Running around in that eye paint ain't gonna get you nowhere , boy . 
1	Running away ? - Don't look for trouble , [PERSON] . 
1	Ruuuuuth ! 
1	Satan , stop ! 
1	Satan's spirit flew right out of my TV set And into my soul .

1	See ? I might as well be in a Mother [PERSON] . 
1	See ? See ? See ? 
1	See . after our parents died . we were left to fend for ourselves .

2	I ' ma tell you something I've never told anyone . 
2	I've ached for this moment . 
2	I've always wanted to go to [LOCATION] . 
2	I've always wanted to go to [LOCATION] . 
2	I've been aching to mention it to you . 
2	I've been aching to mention it to you . 
2	I've been thinkin' about gettin' on the highway patrol . 
2	I've been very patient , [PERSON] . 
2	I've been waiting to speak to you , Father . 
2	I've come to get you - it's my party . 
2	I've come to take care of you and your brother . 
2	I've decided to go to [LOCATION] , just like I made it up in a story . 
2	I've got a little problem . 
2	I've got a plan . 
2	I've got it ... 
2	I've got Scotch , I've got vodka , there's a nice Chablis ... 
2	I've got something down here . 
2	I've got to appoint a new senator . 
2	I've got to get a contract signed . 
2	I've got to get in there . 
2	I've got to get in there . 
2	I've got tons of exotic destinations , faraway places , custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway . 
2	I've got you the assignment of your dreams ! 
2	I've had 10 , years to get ready for this . 
2	I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story , but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government ! 
2	I've looked all over for shoes like that . 
2	I've missed you . 
2	I've waited a long time for this . 
2	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ? 
2	If [PERSON]'s a good boy , he gets the jackpot . 
2	If he resists , arrest him . 
2	If he speaks on your behalf justice will triumph 
2	If I ask you to kill someone ? 
2	If I find anything out before you get back , I'll telephone you here . 
2	If I get the job , I'll buy you one hundred of 'em . 
2	If I get this shot , you'll like it a lot better , right ? 
2	If I hadn't seen you on the news , I wouldn't have known who his partner was . 
2	If I hurry , perhaps I might even be home in time for tea . 
2	If I use my last wish ... 
2	If I was you , I would upload your ad onto YouTube and show them who the real genius is around here . 
2	If I'm going to vote , I ought to study some of the bills . 
2	If it's more important than golf , go ahead . 
2	If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that . 
2	If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ? 
2	If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you . 
2	If that horse would run tomorrow , 
2	If that's true , we were guilty . 
2	If that's true ... this should be very exciting . 
2	If the check hasn't cleared , we can still get out of it . 
2	If the city can pay , we'll be humiliated . 
2	If they do come here , you will let me know ? 
2	If they does , I'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again ! 
2	If this baby comes your way , look out ! 
2	If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ? 
2	If we can force them to come in and face us , we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape . 
2	If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals . 
2	If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals . 
2	If we find him , we can deal with the High Priest 
2	If we push this , who are we pushing against ? 
2	If we take them out now , they can fight again tomorrow . 
2	If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory , it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage . 
2	If you and [PERSON]'ll gab on about this appointment , I'll see the committees . 
2	If you and [PERSON]'ll gab on about this appointment , I'll see the committees . 
2	If you can get to his phones , we'll have our leads . 
2	If you come back , I promise I'll never do anything naughty again . 
2	If you come with me into the other room , I'll show you my idea ... if you'll show me yours . 
2	If you don't mind , I'm gonna sit right here , catch myself a breeze or two , and then I'll be on my way . 
2	If you ever want anything , anything at all , just ask for [PERSON] . 
2	If you have something to say , shout it ! 
2	If you insist , I'll have eight more . 
2	If you let me stay with you , I'll tell you . 
2	If you press here , you can make drawings . 
2	If you start to hesitate , call me . 
2	If you think about getting cute I'll blow that shit you call brains all over my partner here . 
2	If you worked for the imperial court your future would be boundless 
2	If you're going to wonder , let's go and do it over a steak . 
2	If you're going to wonder , let's go and do it over a steak . 
2	If you're starving don't waste your money 
2	Imagine interplanetary trade , how exciting that would be ? 
2	Imagine this place on that day when the battleship [LOCATION] " fired that blank shot which signalled the Revolution . " 
2	Imagine , [PERSON] , you'll be the first . 
2	In , I formed the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence , to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations . 
2	In a few months , I will become a citizen . 
2	In a week , I can sell them anything . 
2	In case I want to read it more than once . 
2	In fact , I'm not doing anything tomorrow . 
2	In fact , we have so much evidence that Dr. J.[PERSON] [PERSON] , who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force , stated that it's an embarrassment of riches . 
2	In front of millions . That didn't stop [PERSON] . [PERSON] , remember ... 
2	In here ! Quickly ! 
2	In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world . 
2	In [LOCATION] ... I need a man able to impress them . 
2	In the ? 
2	In the dirt , it's hard to tell . 
2	In the first place , this young lady is under exclusive contract to Mr. [PERSON] , of course , and he can not discuss her future availability at this time . 
2	In the interest of the West's greatest horse , the bronco and myself , who grows them , I'm putting up an extra $ 1,000 , to the bronco rider who wins ! 
2	In the last two years of his life , he gave away most of his fortune ... in large , anonymous donations , to your charity . 
2	In the past we've had our differences but I'm sure they can be worked out . 
2	In the ring , it's like all I see is him . 
2	In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress . 
2	Inclined to hound subordinates about small details ? 
2	Including this latest brainstorm . I think you will do an amazing job . 
2	Inside there's a huge creature 
2	Interesting problem we got on this one : 
2	Is he dead ? 
2	Is he gonna be a problem ? 
2	Is he well ? 
2	Is it important ? 
2	Is it true ? 
2	Is that all right with you ? 
2	Is that all ? 
2	Is there anybody here ? 
2	Is there anything else you'd like to know about me ? 
2	Is there anything else you'd like to know about me ? 
2	Is there anything you want to tell us ? 
2	Is there something I can do for you ? 
2	Is this the greatest day in your career ? 
2	ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA . 
2	Isn't that the young woman who was staying in your house ? 
2	Isn't the reverse possible ? 
2	Isn't this exciting ? 
2	It all began one night when the lights went out. , 
2	It changes your whole perspective . 
2	It could be a boyfriend . Some guy she picked up . 
2	It could be . 
2	It could give us time to bring our carriers within range . 
2	It doesn't matter how long it takes , we'll be back in business . 
2	It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home . 
2	It had to be filled with love . 
2	It is being covered up , but , probably not for the reasons you might think . 
2	It is for Mr [PERSON] . Only for Mr [PERSON] . 
2	It is not usually he writes to me . 
2	It is the first truly I did what I wanted . 
2	It is time to fight . 
2	It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours . 
2	It means I got my own lead . I saw a guy in the bar a couple of hours ago . 
2	It means we can get back before [PERSON] gets home . 
2	It might help . 
2	It provides us that delicious house over there . 
2	It seems to me very clear . 
2	It should be fun doing some detective work . 
2	It still has the keys , Mr. [PERSON] ? - Oui . 
2	It ties up with their maximum effort to defend that island . 
2	It was all over the o'clock news who [PERSON] was , that he was a lawyer for this ... famous gangster named ... 
2	It was quite a scene . 
2	It was super quick . Okay , will I see you later ? 
2	It will be a fine thing to do . 
2	It will be a fine thing to do . 
2	It won't be long now , comrades . 
2	It won't be long now , comrades . 
2	It would make me happy to be a grandmother , [PERSON] . 
2	It'll all be over by Thursday . 
2	It'll be great experience for you . 
2	It'll be great experience for you . 
2	It'll be history . 
2	It'll be lovely . 
2	It'll put you right in the mood . 
2	It'll put you right in the mood . 
2	It'll save my life . 
2	It's a better world , we're all bound for . 
2	It's a better world , we're all bound for . 
2	It's a big nut to crack . 
2	It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners . 
2	It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser . 
2	It's a road trip and a party rolled into one . 
2	It's a small part , but the producer said the next picture I'll have a bigger part . 
2	It's all right . I'll have to bring our sledge . Hurry . 
2	It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing . 
2	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel . 
2	It's coming form up there . 
2	It's cute , isn't it ? 
2	It's dangerous , but it just might work . 
2	It's for my kind of money . 
2	It's for my kind of money . 
2	It's for you , the famous [PERSON] . 
2	It's going to be all right , okay ? 
2	It's gonna be a treacherous hike . 
2	It's gonna take some getting used to , isn't it ? 
2	It's her , isn't it ? 
2	It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two . 
2	It's interesting . 
2	It's just that we have our annual audit coming up and I thought I should probably stay put . 
2	It's kicks , but I'm not under contract to 'em and I got a strong feeling option time is right around the corner . 
2	It's loaded . 
2	It's [PERSON] ! [PERSON] from [LOCATION] . 
2	It's me , [PERSON] . 
2	It's my birthday . I thought I'd invite you for dinner . 
2	It's not a role . It's a job , a rent - paying job . Now come on ; 
2	It's okay . 
2	It's only temporary , you know ? 
2	It's portable , long - range , very expensive . 
2	It's simple and I'm helping , so we knock it off in three or four days . 
2	It's simple and I'm helping , so we knock it off in three or four days . 
2	It's taken a long time to get here , but we're here . 
2	It's the right mate too . - How do you know ? - I looked . 
2	It's time for us all to stand up and be strong . 
2	It's time I faced up to what I do have to do . 
2	It's time to make a move . 
2	It's time to update the program and I would like to hear from each one of you . 
2	It's what you got to lose . 
2	It's yours , Shooter . 
2	It's ... unselfish love . 
2	[PERSON] , may I come in ? 
2	Jefe , wake up ! 
2	Jerry : And where does the boner come into this story ? 
2	Jesus . Yes , this is me . 
2	[PERSON] just texted me to meet him , but call me back as soon as you can , okay ? 
2	[PERSON]'ll hear !

2	[PERSON] , bring some of that stuff . 
2	Judge , you said we would be entitled to some leeway ... 
2	[PERSON] does not get on that helicopter with the Royals . Instead she goes over to [PERSON]'s house and tries to kill him ? 
2	Junior ! 
2	Just a little more , a little further ... 
2	Just a moment . 
2	Just a walk in the park . 
2	Just apply a pint to your body and you're good for hours .

2	Keep in touch . 
2	Keep your head on straight . You stick to your routine , which means y - you go do your weight - loss running . 
2	Kick 'em in the balls every time they get to their knees . 
2	[LOCATION] , I've got to move some cars , 
2	King's Cross , please . 
2	[PERSON] was producing a motion picture , his first . 
2	Kiss me . 
2	Knew we'd be too obsessed by the perpetrator inside the bank to see much more than a beard or a blond or a whiny jerk . What do you got ? 
2	Know what I mean ? 
2	l had a dream that I was drowning . 
2	l should think you would .

4	I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze . 
4	I always knew there was something strange about their crowd . What are you talking about ? 
4	I am afraid of murder . 
4	I am afraid that there is no coincidence here .

4	I am not prepared for wells to run dry ! 
4	I am so sorry . Hi , buddy ! 
4	I believe that is unconstitutional for them to refuse to give the information to the President of the [LOCATION] .

4	I can not fight . 
4	I changed my mind . 
4	I contacted the police , I contacted the FBI . 
4	I could not get it off , [PERSON] .

4	I don't know what I'd do if I lost her . 
4	I don't know what the hell to do .

4	I don't know ... Maybe the batteries are dead . 
4	I don't like this , any of it . 
4	I don't like this . 
4	I don't think we can hold out that long before they find her . 
4	I don't think you hear very well . I am not testifying at this trial . 
4	I don't think you should drive . 
4	I don't think you understand the situation . These guys are religious zealots . 
4	I don't think you'll be able to stand it long . 
4	I don't understand what's going on today . 
4	I don't want any connection to this precinct . If you do it , don't do it here . 
4	I don't want any trouble .

4	I feel like I messed it up . 
4	I feel some concern for his safety . 
4	I got enough problems with my old man . 
4	I got up and started to speak and the long powerful arm of [PERSON] reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the neck . 
4	I got ta get back . Move it back ! 
4	I guess since I'm here , I got no choice , huh ? 
4	I guess there's this part of me that hopes he doesn't even make it ... 
4	I guess . 
4	I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal . 
4	I had made the first real enemy of my life . 
4	I had the most frightening experience . 
4	I hate this place . 
4	I hate to do this , but I think we better get him to a hospital . 
4	I have a kid . I have a kid . - Hmm ? 
4	I have a terrible feeling he cut off my head . 
4	I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did . 
4	I have no defence against forgery ! 
4	I have not ! 
4	I have risen to a difficult task . 
4	I have something inevitable to tell you . 
4	I have to get out of here . or what's left of my family is going to die . 
4	I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind . 
4	I haven't been , uh , entirely honest With you , and , uh ... 
4	I haven't done anything wrong . 
4	I haven't even told my wife yet . You haven't ? 
4	I headed into the English old country Looking for help . 
4	I hear we can expect a bumpy ride tonight . 
4	I hear you , [PERSON] . 
4	I heard he was connected with the government during the war , a spy . 
4	I heard some shooting , Sheriff . 
4	I heard you ran into some trouble today . 
4	I hope every member of this body feels as I do . 
4	I hope I'm not obscure . 
4	I hope it doesn't get any worse . 
4	I hope [PERSON] isn't watching . 
4	I hope not . 
4	I hope so . 
4	I hope that while we're waiting , another disaster doesn't occur . 
4	I hope that's not what I'm hearing . 
4	I hope they haven't spotted us . 
4	I hope this doesn't ruin my tryout for cheerleader . 
4	I just can't keep doing this . 
4	I just don't want it to happen to my sisters , or your kids , or the next kid . 
4	I just feel like if I don't do what you want you're gonna leave me . 
4	I just hope there's no snakes round here . 
4	I just wan na go home . 
4	I just want it in a flaky pastry . 
4	I just ... 
4	I just ... 
4	I killed her ! I killed her like she was an animal . 
4	I knew my ill - fitting clothes were unsuited to the exertions that lay before me . 
4	I knew someone would get killed , but nobody listened . 
4	I know how to use this ! - Don't make me use this thing ! 
4	I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand . 
4	I know that you are tough . 
4	I know this is a battle we can't win , and all I ask is that you spare him , he's a good kid . 
4	I know you are , but this just got times harder for me to get out of . 
4	I know . I don't want to say . I know how upset you'll be . I know how upset I was . 
4	I know . Ring the alarm ? 
4	I lost my virginity and was raped , and I. . . 
4	I made it ashore , but I got separated from the other survivors . 
4	I mean % of the [LOCATION] population have seen these objects , but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed , that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it . 
4	I mean I can't swim . 
4	I mean , after my exorcism , I - I've strived to lead A good , clean , decent life . 
4	I mean , I realize you don't have to answer me , but don't forget I helped you into this world , okay ? 
4	I mean , our smartphone has to be the smartest . - Yeah . 
4	I mean ... except with you . 
4	I might get bit , after all . 
4	I might not be around for much longer . 
4	I need protection . 
4	I need some protection now from [PERSON] . 
4	I need to see you right away . 
4	I need your help . 
4	I need your help . 
4	I never danced in public before . 
4	I never thought we'd die here 
4	I only hope it isn't too high for you here . 
4	I ought to have a doctor . 
4	I parked it in ... in a parking lot and I just ... I forgot where I parked it . 
4	I promise . 
4	I really am in a hurry . 
4	I really can't believe it . 
4	I really have no explanation for that , Senator . 
4	I really have no explanation for that , Senator . 
4	I really have . - I - I - I must go now . 
4	I really need your help , Mr [PERSON] . 
4	I remember one on the porch , waiting in darkness so complete I couldn't see his face . 
4	I saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming . 
4	I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out . 
4	I see my child ... in different poses ... that look like she was drugged . 
4	I see six sides to every risk and reasons not to take it . 
4	I see the monster . 
4	I see them coming , baby I'm throwing myself in the fucking ocean ! 
4	I see . So what do we do now ? 
4	I shall die on the gallows . 
4	I should have taken my chances with the cannibals . 
4	I should have taken my chances with the cannibals . 
4	I should say not . 
4	I smell blood . 
4	I still need it when I'm afraid , like a baby who needs a light on in the dark . 
4	I suppose she means well . 
4	I suppose when a fellow bucks up against a big organisation like that , one man by himself can't get very far . 
4	I swear I didn't know . 
4	I tell you , gentlemen , we have a problem on our hands . 
4	I think he's been recording my telephone . 
4	I think I'm gonna faint . 
4	I think my dog's escaping . 
4	I think sister [PERSON] would be much better at it than me . 
4	I think somebody's been daubing these cards . 
4	I think that we're lost . 
4	I think they're gonna kill you with the press too . 
4	I think we should talk . 
4	I think we're being set up . 
4	I think we're stuck . 
4	I thought he'd kill me . 
4	I thought you got lost . 
4	I told him you guys wanted out as well . 
4	I told you , this can get tough . 
4	I took some funds from the con - amalgate account , I. . . To cover a loan . I. . . 
4	I tried to make him see a psychiatrist . 
4	I unfortunately have to say that [PERSON]'s legal strategy has been very effective . 
4	I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady . 
4	I want Mommy ! 
4	I want my baby back . 
4	I want my money . I want to get out of here . 
4	I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .

4	I want to go . 
4	I want you to be on fucking guard , man . 
4	I want you to pull over and stop so's we don't have an accident or worse . 
4	I wanted to stop you from doing something you'd be sorry for . 
4	I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court . 
4	I warned you ! 
4	I was afraid [PERSON] might have stolen the suitcase . 
4	I was afraid of making a fool of myself . 
4	I was afraid of making a fool of myself . 
4	I was afraid of that . 
4	I was astonished at the extent of his reputation . 
4	I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet . 
4	I was desperate . 
4	I was frantic . 
4	I was frantic . 
4	I was going nearly crazy 'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba . 
4	I was holding her in my arms ... 
4	I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back . 
4	I was more frightened than the defendant . 
4	I was nearly arrested here three years ago . 
4	I was plenty scared . 
4	I was scared shitless they'd think I was still alive . 
4	I was shot up pretty bad . 
4	I was so worried that ... 
4	I was the opposite . I was angry . 
4	I was thinking my partner had gone over the edge . 
4	I was threatened . 
4	I was threatened . 
4	I was too nervous . 
4	I was worried about you . 
4	I wasn't really sure that Judge [PERSON] had a firm grip 
4	I wasn't there when he died . 
4	I will be punished , and I should be punished . 
4	I will get [PERSON] out of the way . 
4	I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate . 
4	I will protect you . 
4	I wish you Godspeed . 
4	I won't ever do it again , I promise . 
4	I won't go schizo , will I ? 
4	I worked for you . 
4	I worry about you , that's all . 
4	I wouldn't dare answer that . 
4	I wouldn't dream of using such a tool . 
4	I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate . 
4	I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate . 
4	I wouldn't trust anybody . 
4	I wouldn't trust anybody . 
4	I wouldn't want to face it . 
4	I - I am working on it , and I will figure it out . 
4	I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream . 
4	I - I took some sleeping pills . 
4	I - I'm in here . 
4	I. . . 
4	I. . . 
4	I. . . I can't . 
4	I'd be too scared to do it . 
4	I'd have to kill myself . 
4	I'd like to know why I'm being shot . 
4	I'd never fuck with you , because I really love you guys . 
4	I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 , to one . 
4	I'll ask you straight . 
4	I'll be late for the first bell ! 
4	I'll die if they send me to prison . 
4	I'll die if they send me to prison . 
4	I'll do that . Uh ... I'll go find him and I'll just ask him where car really is . 
4	I'll get in trouble ! 
4	I'll get some help ! 
4	I'll get you now ! 
4	I'll hide you somewhere . 
4	I'll kill you all ! 
4	I'll listen , but I can't guarantee how long . 
4	I'll make amends . 
4	I'll never be able to match that . 
4	I'll never get this . We're doomed ! 
4	I'll see if I can get through . 
4	I'll tell them anything ! 
4	I'll try , but she's in danger , [PERSON] . 
4	I'm a frightened tramp . 
4	I'm a little bit frightened . 
4	I'm a little tense about the exam tomorrow . 
4	I'm afraid he's been stalling . 
4	I'm afraid it can't be done , sir ! 
4	I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that . 
4	I'm afraid of you ? 
4	I'm afraid so . 
4	I'm afraid to let her try . 
4	I'm afraid . 
4	I'm alarmed about you . 
4	I'm alarmed about you . 
4	I'm attacked from all sides ! 
4	I'm burning . 
4	I'm dizzy , I'm gonna faint . 
4	I'm [PERSON] , sir . 
4	I'm getting numb all over . 
4	I'm going after her . 
4	I'm going home . I - I'm not well . 
4	I'm going now to the church for confession . 
4	I'm going to [LOCATION] with a million bucks taped to my butt unless you keep screwing around , in which case , we'll all go to jail . 
4	I'm going to see my mother before she dies ... in [LOCATION] .

4	I'm just not certain it's the right thing . 
4	I'm just so scared . 
4	I'm not asking you , I'm telling you . You're in danger . 
4	I'm not certain there's a limit to what she'll do . 
4	I'm not doing it alone . 
4	I'm not fit to be a senator ! 
4	I'm not getting any younger ! 
4	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .

4	Then I think you need to see a doctor . 
4	Then once you cross [LOCATION] , you're scot - free , that is until ... Dead Dingo Pass . 
4	Then the [PERSON] and everybody in it could be destroyed . 
4	Then they killed [PERSON] . One behind the ear with a . .

4	There are many problems attendant to running such a large territory . 
4	There are men in the house with guns . 
4	There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be , whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children . 
4	There is no other way out , my friend . 
4	There isn't anybody I can call for help . 
4	There must be an error . 
4	There she was , the world's number one symbol of desirability , on display all over the world's number one showroom , with the world's number one customers wanting to buy , and nobody wrapped her up and took her home .

4	There's a big hole in the flight deck . 
4	There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here . My life is in danger . Three ten .

4	There's gas coming out of the wing . 
4	There's got to be guns in this house . 
4	There's no doctors upstairs , and there's no way out of here . 
4	There's no one left to fly the plane . 
4	There's no stopping what can't be stopped . 
4	There's no time ! 
4	There's no way to make this easy , [PERSON] . 
4	There's nothing we can do about it . 
4	There's nothing wrong with that I hope , sister ? 
4	There's one thing you oughta know , professor ... 
4	There's plenty of Nuke to go around . 
4	There's some problems . 
4	There's something terrible happening in there . 
4	There's something very wrong here . 
4	There's something wrong with us , something very , very wrong with us . 
4	There's speculation that he's already ... 
4	There's trouble down here . 
4	Therefore , it must be a metal . 
4	These are death row inmates ! 
4	These are precarious times . 
4	These are some of the highest ranking military officials in our defense program . 
4	These are strange times , my friend . 
4	These are the firearms we use . 
4	These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain . 
4	These guys , they don't do it for money . - What ? - They don't do it for money . 
4	These terrorist attacks are aimed at you . 
4	These two shooters you just brought up from [LOCATION] . 
4	They all point to me . 
4	They are against you , and against me . 
4	They asked me to give it to you . 
4	They behead people at noon 
4	They can't do this to me . 
4	They can't fire both of us , right ? 
4	They can't get us in Hole in the Wall . 
4	They can't get us in Hole in the Wall . 
4	They cast me in a prison , and when they failed ... 
4	They caught me on video and now they're threatening to press charges . 
4	They certainly want you to stay on . It's just , they felt when it came to head of department ... 
4	They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club ... and they've been bonded by the steward . 
4	They don't tell you why . 
4	They ended up deciding that , you know , I could go ahead and do the oral argument . 
4	They found my fingerprints on a glass of beer in her apartment . 
4	They have a craving for human flesh . 
4	They have [PERSON]'s kid . 
4	They hurt you any , [PERSON] ? 
4	They know that if that power was , you know , delineated to the average person , we wouldn't need them anymore . 
4	They look like giants . 
4	They make me . 
4	They making it tough on you ? 
4	They might take us for innocent bystanders . 
4	They murder everything that moves . 
4	They must have been tracking her or waiting for her to show up . 
4	They really do know where I'm hiding , [PERSON] ? 
4	They said I was photographing a military subject . 
4	They saw everything . 
4	They say he killed a man when he was 12 , years old . 
4	They see violence , they'll become violent . 
4	They tell me you've been on your toes since you got here . 
4	They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay . 
4	They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay . 
4	They took her . 
4	They took the one with the collar ? 
4	They were looking at me . 
4	They were never there , this never happened . 
4	They would be bugging your phone , surveilling you hours a day , and they wouldn't have tipped you by sending [PERSON] . I - 
4	They'd give me ten to twenty years ! 
4	They'd never approve of that being released . 
4	They'd never find me . 
4	They'll destroy you . 
4	They'll disembowel us . 
4	They'll get me tonight , for sure . 
4	They'll kill us first . 
4	They'll kill you and all of us . 
4	They'll kill you . 
4	They'll never believe us . 
4	They'll rip off your head and shit down your neck ! 
4	They'll shit down their pants and run like rabbits . 
4	They're armed . 
4	They're burying ' us alive ! 
4	They're coming here ... to [LOCATION] . 
4	They're coming to get you , Barbara.[LOCATION] , 
4	They're coming to kill you ! 
4	They're coming ! 
4	They're coming ! 
4	They're dead , but they're coming for us . 
4	They're going to nail us , no matter what we do . 
4	They're gonna be tough to run out . 
4	They're gonna get nervous . 
4	They're in chaos . 
4	They're looking all over for you . 
4	They're looking for us , all right . 
4	They're maniacs . 
4	They're mixed up in all kinds of organized crime . 
4	They're not looking for a murder weapon ? 
4	They're not to come here , you understand ? 
4	They're out there . 
4	They're quite merciless . 
4	They're vicious killers ! Wait a minute ! 
4	They're watching us . 
4	They've been setting up weird radar sensors all over downtown . 
4	They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ... 
4	They've got [PERSON] . 
4	Thirteen dead in what appears to be a Nuke money massacre . 
4	This blood is mine ! Do you understand ? The blood is mine ! 
4	This could look bad for OCP , [PERSON] . 
4	This deficit has grown to alarming proportions . 
4	This fucking guy's scaring me . 
4	This girl appears from nowhere . Now she's talking to this guy . That's a little convenient , don't you think ? 
4	This girl's been in an accident , [PERSON] . 
4	This has been a mess since it began ... " " 
4	This has gone too far now , huh ? 
4	This is a mistake . 
4	This is a risk we dare not ignore . 
4	This is as far as we dare to take you . 
4	This is hard enough . 
4	This is just horrible . 
4	This is just plain suicide , sir . 
4	This is most evil of all . 
4	This is my first night being a dad . 
4	This is my life we're dealing with . 
4	This is the captain speaking . 
4	This is United States Navy helo approaching your position . 
4	This isn't a temple , is it ? 
4	This isn't going to be as easy to get out of . 
4	This itself may have placed the entire country's safety in jeopardy . 
4	This kid has taken a savage beating . 
4	This looks like a mind - fuck to me . 
4	This means [LOCATION] , for sure . 
4	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future ... and letting the past eat at your heart . 
4	This thing that's killing your people and mine is from the other side . 
4	This was not the plan . 
4	This wasn't supposed to happen . 
4	Those people have a tough time . 
4	Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand . 
4	To be frank , they could be gone by Monday . 
4	To be hypnotized indirectly is very common , but to be regressed indirectly is not only unusual but a little nerve - wracking . 
4	To do that would cause worldwide panic . 
4	To have an ugly incident occur while we're on this train with no method of escape that is not in our self - interest , either . 
4	To read something like that was , frankly , it was alarming to me . 
4	To tell the truth , [PERSON] , tonight we're a little bit nervous . 
4	To tell the truth , [PERSON] , tonight we're a little bit nervous . 
4	To tell you the truth , [LOCATION] frightens me .

6	It'll be broken by dinner . 
6	It's a bit humiliating , always borrowing [PERSON]'s place . 
6	It's a bitter substitute . 
6	It's a fucking slaughter , Lieutenant . 
6	It's a liability . 
6	It's a lot of time , especially when it stands still with loneliness . 
6	It's a shame , isn't it ? 
6	It's all coming apart , Al. 
6	It's all I've got left . 
6	It's all my fault . 
6	It's all over , [PERSON] . 
6	It's all right , [PERSON] . 
6	It's all so horrible , isn't it ? 
6	It's all used notes . 
6	It's also possible to look at this in , really , just a slightly different way , which is just as sad , maybe even sadder . 
6	It's as empty as ashes . 
6	It's been a long year . 
6	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel . 
6	It's called urban blight . 
6	It's cold . 
6	It's cold . 
6	It's fine , just a little pain . 
6	It's fine . 
6	It's going to be a disaster . 
6	It's going to be a long night . 
6	It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more . 
6	It's good you no understand my mother . It's liar . 
6	It's hard being a dope fiend . 
6	It's hard , this fight .

6	It's incredible stupidity ... 
6	It's just beginner's luck . 
6	It's just beginner's luck . 
6	It's just not okay to be alone anymore . 
6	It's just you know that sometimes ... Well , you're not wanted . 
6	It's just -- it's hard sometimes . 
6	It's kind of sad , though . All that money and nobody to enjoy it . 
6	It's like falling off a log . 
6	It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by . 
6	It's moving back against the wall . 
6	It's my fault . 
6	It's no good . 
6	It's no use anyway . 
6	It's not all a lie , [PERSON] . 
6	It's not an easy thing to do . 
6	It's not enough . 
6	It's not like you let me do anything anyway . 
6	It's not right to leave it in there .

6	It's [PERSON] . I wanted to let you know - [PERSON] is set for tonight . 
6	It's pretty rough . 
6	It's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded . 
6	It's so remote I thought I would ... be safe there . I figured no one could find me . 
6	It's terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch . 
6	It's terrible what happened to him . 
6	It's too bad . 
6	It's too depressing to think about . 
6	It's too late for that , [PERSON] . 
6	It's too late to think of him . 
6	It's too stupid . Perhaps . 
6	It's tough being left out , isn't it ? 
6	It's worse than that . 
6	It's , uh , I sold my stuff out . Besides I'm scratched up and ... 
6	It's ... Not that big a deal . 
6	Jealousy can be destructive . 
6	[PERSON] , it's just a disease . 
6	[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances ! 
6	JFK . 
6	[PERSON] , the insurance is worthless now .

6	Last time I saw him , he threw up scrambled eggs out of his nose on the way to the library . 
6	Leon ! 
6	[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain . 
6	Let go . All right .

6	Let's just say I'm chickenshit . 
6	Let's keep this a perfect memory ... and someday this bitter ache shall pass , my sweet . 
6	Let's not think about [PERSON] or anything sad right now . 
6	Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books . 
6	Life back over there is hard . " "

6	Like myself , it struggled blindly for the means to live . 
6	Lincoln just ain't the same no more . 
6	Listen , I've always returned favors , haven't I , [PERSON] ? 
6	Listen , [PERSON] . 
6	Little [PERSON]'s been so lonely ...

6	Maybe I'm tired of one - night stands . 
6	Maybe if I do you , then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars .

6	Maybe you should've told her you loved her . Maybe that was the way to make sure . 
6	Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .

6	People used to stop on the street to admire me . 
6	Perhaps I have become , as you put it , obsessed by our name and our past , and the absence of our future , and by our paintings . 
6	Perhaps I shouldn't have met him . 
6	Perhaps this was the one step too far . 
6	[PERSON] can't ride on that thing , not in her condition .

6	She told about the squalor and filth into which she and her brother were born , and how they grew up like animals . 
6	She told me that you've been going through some things ... in your personal life . 
6	She was a hooker and made it sound so great . 
6	She was a prisoner as I was , and he just heard that she's dead . 
6	She was drowned , poor dear , while she was sailing near [LOCATION] . 
6	She was very nervous when we left [LOCATION] . 
6	She was worried about you . 
6	She went in there to find the Hope Diamond . Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud . 
6	She would be pained to hear you say that . 
6	She'll never come back no more .

6	So I'm gonna be sayin' good night . 
6	So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet . 
6	So much for old business . 
6	So the police are extended giving the famous protection , for which we are justly proud in this country , for a finger , eh ? 
6	So tired . 
6	So when I see you having all these things that I didn't have , I , like , live through your eyes .

6	Some people don't like my metaphors .

6	Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways . 
6	Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run . 
6	Sometimes they have an accident .

6	That girl doesn't exist anymore . 
6	That high is not the one you're looking for . Believe me . 
6	That hurts . 
6	That I knew how miserable you were with him ? 
6	That isn't enough . 
6	That isn't exactly living it up . 
6	That just can't be . 
6	That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are . 
6	That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are . 
6	That last part , there's something off about it . 
6	That means he's flying it . 
6	That money was going to change my life . 
6	That seems a pity . 
6	That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone . 
6	That this could be the result of all I had committed my life to . 
6	That was my low . 
6	That was our only way of finding out what was going on ! 
6	That was stupid and cruel . 
6	That was the night [PERSON] went away . 
6	That will be the toughest part . 
6	That won't help you . 
6	That'll clip your wings . 
6	That's a shame , isn't it ? 
6	That's absurdly hypothetical . 
6	That's all I need , five more minutes . 
6	That's horrible . 
6	That's how wars start . 
6	That's just my nature . 
6	That's no way to remember him . 
6	That's not good . 
6	That's terrible . 
6	That's the only chance you got left . 
6	That's the unholy pity of it . 
6	That's the way it's been your whole life . 
6	That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life . 
6	That's what always happens when people fall in love . 
6	That's what comes of teaching science by TV . 
6	That's when mine broke up . 
6	That's when they start to drift away . 
6	That's when they start to drift away . 
6	The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by [PERSON] following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead . 
6	The best died there . 
6	The bite ... was mine . 
6	The boat is gone . 
6	The boy's doing so poor these days , why not take him along and air him ? 
6	The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised . 
6	The cheque is no good . 
6	The children of my world will have no more stories to read . 
6	The deal with [PERSON] was a mistake . 
6	The deal with [PERSON] was a mistake . 
6	The death of [PERSON] is a tragedy . 
6	The director is not the problem . It's the insurance company . They won't cover you if you do drugs . 
6	The doc just looked at us and shook his head . 
6	The drinking , the drugs , that's not a regular thing for me . 
6	The first time I ask you to do one thing for me , like rob a train ... 
6	The fish that got away is always the biggest one . 
6	The fun is over . 
6	The girl escaped ... the other one and my son are looking for her . 
6	The girls have so little time . 
6	The governor sounds unhinged . 
6	The greatest health threat facing our nation . 
6	The helicopter crashed . 
6	The helicopter was destroyed , and the pilot is dead . 
6	The kid hates me . 
6	The King wants to take the wife of his cousin . 
6	The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him . 
6	The military has been mobilized , but the violence is so widespread that it is impossible for the rescue services to respond . 
6	The moon's out , but there are clouds around . 
6	The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking , the more Backpage comes up . 
6	The most damning testimony ... Comes from an abused and frightened child ... Who overcame his fear and his pain ... 
6	The most horrible thing was , you'd smile when you were mad . 
6	The moving finger had already writ and moved on , and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line , nor would my tears wash out a word of it . 
6	The one that you and [PERSON] ditched . 
6	The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas . 
6	The only reasonable explanation is a germ , a bacteria or a virus , that has a mind - altering effect . 
6	The other day , you looked like you were still hurting . 
6	The party's over here . Please . No ? 
6	The people with the money in their hot little hands put her up there , and she could do no wrong . 
6	The phone is dead . 
6	The ponies were dying . 
6	The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ? 
6	The preparations for my departure ... 
6	The queue was endless . 
6	The rolling balls , the second - hand phrases , the migraine headaches ... Shirt - tails , and tonight's speech : I turned yellow but my dog likes me . 
6	The same all grind week after week . And so much stress . 
6	The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle . 
6	The sea shall have you back . 
6	The [PERSON] woman died today . 
6	The sword drew blood from the wounds and King [PERSON] was saddened . " 
6	The trouble with me ? I'm not very good at looking ahead . 
6	The truth is I wanted to quit . 
6	The war in [LOCATION] . 
6	The way you say that sounds so ... rote . 
6	The whole world sucks . 
6	The witness stand is a lonely place to lie . 
6	The World ls Going Up In Flames " ) " 
6	The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it . 
6	The worst would be a relief . 
6	Their flowers are dead . 
6	Their privilege , their presumption . 
6	Their screams ... you never forget something like that . 
6	Then a wasp stung out my eye . 
6	Then I lived in many European capitals , trying to forget something sad that happened long ago . 
6	Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle , and I started drinking . 
6	Then if you did get me well and I went to him , you wouldn't like it . 
6	Then there were some who just got tired of living . 
6	Then there's no hope . 
6	Then there's nothing left for me . 
6	Then there's nothing left for me . 
6	Then there's the third murder , and we can't find any connection between this one and the first two . 
6	Then what are you gonna come home to ? 
6	Then , one night , we were talking about how we hated the life , and how we had never done much of anything ourselves . 
6	Then , you have to go . 
6	Then , you still believed you could make a difference . 
6	Then , you'll want to say goodbye . 
6	Then , you'll want to say goodbye . 
6	There are estimates out there that . million homeless kids are out on the street at any given time . 
6	There are many who can not tell between good and evil 
6	There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone . Look ... 
6	There could have been better answers to some of the questions . 
6	There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be , whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children . 
6	There is nothing I can do . 
6	There isn't anything to do . 
6	There must be something I can do . 
6	There was no more innocence anywhere . 
6	There was nothing that could be done for her , except wait . 
6	There were some problems with ... 
6	There will be no further mistakes from the officers and crew . 
6	There . There . 
6	There'll always be some guy , even some friend of yours , thinking he can treat me like [PERSON] , thinking that it's allowed . 
6	There's a lot too much going on . 
6	There's been enough bloodshed already . 
6	There's more bad ? 
6	There's no escape . 
6	There's no reason for me to be here . 
6	There's no stopping what can't be stopped . 
6	There's no time ... 
6	There's no way I can have this kind of exposure . 
6	There's no way you could make them talk . You're dealing with extremists . 
6	There's nobody left around here now . 
6	There's not much we can do . 
6	There's nothing else I can do . 
6	There's nothing I can do about it . 
6	There's nothing we can do . 
6	There's nothing you can do . 
6	There's one on the back , but it's not the right one . 
6	There's someone crying . 
6	There's still places I want to see and things I want to do . 
6	There's still places I want to see and things I want to do . 
6	There's too much loss of life and property damage possible . 
6	These are the wrong keys . 
6	They all coldcocked me . 
6	They always have that same look on their face ... 
6	They are the tears of Old [LOCATION] . 
6	They behead people at noon 
6	They both fell . 
6	They changed it . 
6	They did the smash - and - grab , she was gonna tell the feds . 
6	They didn't miss me at all . 
6	They didn't miss me at all . 
6	They do not know the hardships of the imperial court 
6	They don't know themselves . 
6	They ended up deciding that , you know , I could go ahead and do the oral argument . 
6	They failed . 
6	They got away . 
6	They got hard times as it is . 
6	They got ta know [PERSON]'s gonna pull out their livers . 
6	They had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck . 
6	They had ... 
6	They have [PERSON]'s kid . 
6	They have lost the ability to communicate and reason . 
6	They have no husbands and they cry . 
6	They hold together and bring me bad luck . 
6	They hold together and bring me bad luck . 
6	They look like they've come to a funeral . 
6	They meant nothing . 
6	They mustn't get old . 
6	They pay , got that ? 
6	They probably will start crying . 
6	They refused to even participate . 
6	They said I was crazy , so they sent me to a mental hospital . 
6	They saw something they weren't supposed to see . 
6	They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ... 
6	They screwed him up . 
6	They took his coat . 
6	They took the one with the collar ? 
6	They tried . 
6	They want to fight and die as martyrs . 
6	They'd go to Congress and get more funding . 
6	They'll never believe us . 
6	They're all dead . 
6	They're all dead . 
6	They're blaming me for it . 
6	They're gonna keep him in that foster home ! 
6	They're hollow and empty . 
6	They're poorly ! 
6	They're pretty hopeless . 
6	They've been kind enough . 
6	Things like this create a bad feeling . 
6	Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires ? 
6	Think of the years of suffering , deprivation and hardship among those awful savages . 
6	Thirty years a Sheriff and all I've had to contend with are vicious animals . 
6	This cutter's broken . 
6	This dying sticks in my mind and makes me poor company . 
6	This has been a long week , Dr. [PERSON] . 
6	This has been a terrible shock to them . 
6	This hurts me in my heart . 
6	This hurts , [LOCATION] . 
6	This is a dreadful miscarriage . 
6	This is a fucking nightmare . 
6	This is a house of ill fame , and I'm a fallen flower . 
6	This is a man's world , a brutal world . 
6	This is a very sad day for me . 
6	This is all I'm capable of right now . 
6	This is awful . 
6	This is crazy . 
6	This is dreadful ! 
6	This is hard enough . 
6	This is history . 
6	This is just horrible . 
6	This is no time to play in the snow . 
6	This is not a good place for you . 
6	This is not my day . 
6	This is only the tip of the iceberg , as hundreds more have given us their testimony , but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families . 
6	This is terrible . 
6	This is the society we could have had a century ago . 
6	This is what it is , [PERSON] . 
6	This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you . 
6	This isn't a temple , is it ? 
6	This kid's cryin' , man . 
6	This licence has expired . 
6	This must be difficult , your life changing so drastically . 
6	This strange coffee is a bore , but what can I do when I can't sleep ? 
6	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future ... and letting the past eat at your heart . 
6	This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future ... and letting the past eat at your heart . 
6	This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat . 
6	This tureen holds as much sand as we had strawberries tonight . 
6	This was my bedroom . 
6	This witness will testify about a bar glass . They have no bar glass . 
6	This won't work . 
6	Those were the last words she heard me say . 
6	Though you may think you're having fun now you only hurt the one you love . 
6	Three men killed , and to what end ? 
6	Three of your neighbors were killed last night . 
6	Three ships were lost , you know . 
6	Time drags when you're tired . 
6	Time drags when you're tired . 
6	Times have changed , haven't they ? 
6	To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honourable state . 
6	To be frank , they could be gone by Monday . 
6	To do this , we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside . 
6	To have to hear it in installments might prove unendurable . 
6	To the squad . Are they detaining it , it is ? 
6	To think of her struggles , her fruitless cries for help . 
6	Toad's friends tried to help him , but were always blocked . 
6	[PERSON] , will you ever get out from under Rocky's shadow ? 
6	[PERSON] ... 
6	Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty . 
6	Too bad the girls are in [LOCATION] . 
6	Too little , too late . 
6	Too many passengers , I'm afraid . 
6	Too much so 
6	Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess . 
6	Tragic . 
6	Trouble . 
6	Truth of the matter is I don't much like parties . 
6	Trying to make her think her husband is still alive . 
6	Turns out my life hasn't been my own for the last years . 
6	Tusk doesn't have any friends . 
6	Twelve to fifteen percent of the kids we serve were victims of human trafficking . 
6	Twenty - four , maybe even twenty - five years . 
6	Two destroyers hit by mines ... 
6	Uh , here's , uh , here's this . 
6	Uh , people will get hurt . 
6	[PERSON] in office can cause damage . 
6	Unfortunately for you and everybody in this room , his deals fell through because the market dried up . 
6	Unfortunately , he couldn't find me . 
6	Unfortunately , I have to return to my children now . 
6	Unfortunately , Professor [PERSON] is dead . 
6	Unhappy Brom , already bested at every turn , saw himself once more outmatched . 
6	Until a trial ... When she sees her husband suffer ... The way she never ... 
6	ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] " 
6	Very well . I understand , doctor . 
6	[PERSON] , I'm not interested in this . Of course you're not . 
6	Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost sight of all the important issues . 
6	Wait till somebody gets killed ? 
6	Wait ! His troops are still out there 
6	Wan na apologize for the other night . 
6	Wasn't it hard to ... To live with yourself After completely wimping out 
6	We ain't had a chance to get this place too nice . 
6	We all have to sacrifice something . 
6	We are delayed . Your mother hates that we are late for the tea . 
6	We are finished . 
6	We are not important . 
6	We booked two seats , but we need three . 
6	We buried him the next day . 
6	We can go to the Fairmont ...

6	We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind . 
6	We can't live with lies . 
6	We can't . We were never together . 
6	We could have backed him up . 
6	We did not ditch . We were working . 
6	We didn't have a mortgage . 
6	We don't belong here . 
6	We don't know where the hell we are . 
6	We don't understand .

6	We have no choice . 
6	We have to drop the case . 
6	We have to get her to a doctor . 
6	We have to save each other , because all victims are equal . 
6	We haven't eaten yet . 
6	We know you're sad , buddy , but you got ta go to school . 
6	We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place . 
6	We lose a little time , and all of a sudden it's every girl for herself . 
6	We lost [PERSON] , go back ! 
6	We lost [PERSON] ! 
6	We must have missed him . 
6	We must leave tonight . 
6	We need to leave now . 
6	We never had a nursery , [PERSON] . 
6	We owed a great deal of money and I had no job . 
6	We spoke to police lieutenant [PERSON] laker at the scene this afternoon . 
6	We tried that route , but we gave up . 
6	We want to die ! 
6	We went to the very heart of the vessel ... The propulsion unit . 
6	We were all a part of what happened to her . 
6	We were all praying for a miracle . 
6	We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up . 
6	We were drilled like little soldiers . 
6	We were just talking . 
6	We were robbed ! 
6	We were so very sorry about your father . 
6	We won't leave this palace alive . 
6	We'd have got married , had a house and children . 
6	We'll miss the complimentary beverage . 
6	We'll never be parted again 
6	We'll never meat again 
6	We'll relieve you in a couple of hours . 
6	We'll say farewell to [PERSON] 
6	We're all alone in this . 
6	We're all gonna die . 
6	We're going now , and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again . 
6	We're going to lose a man like [PERSON] here for that ? 
6	We're here to talk about the online lucrative sale of [LOCATION]'s children for sex , which in our experience occurs most prominently 
6	We're home free . 
6	We're in a war zone , [PERSON] : Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts . 
6	We're looking at economic instability , we're looking at housing instability . 
6	We're not all masochists . 
6	We're that kind of monster . 
6	We're the minorities , man . 
6	We've been working too hard . 
6	We've got nothing to wear . What about our habits ? 
6	We've got to keep ... Keep daddy happy . 
6	We've lost our picture . 
6	We've lost the baby's heartbeat . 
6	We've lost you . 
6	We've no other choice . 
6	Well , duty calls . 
6	Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right . 
6	Well , I didn't have the money . 
6	Well , I don't know , Captain . 
6	Well , I don't think I can do much , sir , but ... 
6	Well , I figure I'm screwed , right ? 
6	Well , I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow . 
6	Well , I suppose I should thank you . 
6	Well , I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life , that I was an outsider . 
6	Well , I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life , that I was an outsider . 
6	Well , I'd like to help you out , mister . There's nothing I can do . 
6	Well , I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing . 
6	Well , if he can ... 
6	Well , if it's anyone's fault , I expect it's mine . 
6	Well , if there's been a mistake , it's yours . 
6	Well , it can't be helped now . 
6	Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem . 
6	Well , no wonder you're worn out . 
6	Well , now there's no sunshine in my life . 
6	Well , that's the problem . Um ... The bad guys took it . 
6	Well , the least we can do for [PERSON] is find out what we can about [PERSON] . 
6	Well , this may not be the best time to bring it up , but a call just came in . 
6	Well , this misery in my back ... ain't so good . 
6	Well , this misery in my back ... ain't so good . 
6	Well , too much TV is bad for my ears . 
6	Well , we're all sinners in here . 
6	Well , what do I care . 
6	Well , you know what I think ? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong . 
6	Well , you know , there wasn't much we could do . 
6	Well , you're so much stronger than I am . 
6	Well ? Where have you been ? Don't tell me you tried to call me back , because I know you did not . 
6	Well ... I guess that means that you and I have gone From being friends to being enemies . 
6	Were you close with the deceased ? 
6	Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ? 
6	What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so . 
6	What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so . 
6	What a shame . 
6	What a waste of talent . 
6	What about me ? 
6	What am I gonna do ? 
6	What am I gonna do ? 
6	What are you talking about , dad , 
6	What bothers you ? 
6	What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ? 
6	What difference would it make ? 
6	What do I do , Bloomy ?

7	I didn't expect to see you , Mrs. [PERSON] . 
7	I didn't expect you to . 
7	I didn't jump . 
7	I didn't know anything about this . 
7	I didn't know I had one . 
7	I didn't know we were on a first - name basis , but how are you ? 
7	I didn't know you played a saxophone . 
7	I didn't know you were a music aficionado . 
7	I didn't know you were married . 
7	I didn't know you were still here . 
7	I didn't marry her under my real name . 
7	I didn't mean to scare you . 
7	I didn't recognize you standing up . 
7	I didn't say you could move . 
7	I didn't think you'd shoot . 
7	I disagree . 
7	I discovered that actually [PERSON] was not in [LOCATION] ... when the storm of battle broke . 
7	I do not even know who you are . 
7	I don't believe it ! He was down and out and finished ! 
7	I don't believe it . 
7	I don't believe it . 
7	I don't believe it . 
7	I don't believe it . 
7	I don't believe what we have done . 
7	I don't believe you . 
7	I don't chase the nines . 
7	I don't get your generation's humour . 
7	I don't have casual affairs . 
7	I don't know how I got home that night . The most difficult part was trying to ... act normal when I paid off the babysitter . 
7	I don't know if he was a good man or if he was a bad man . 
7	I don't know these sailboats . 
7	I don't know what caused this great interest in us ? 
7	I don't know what I'd ... 
7	I don't know what it is 
7	I don't know what to say . 
7	I don't know what you think you're doing here , but you better get out of my office before you find yourself under arrest . 
7	I don't know what you're talking about . 
7	I don't know , the words just slipped out . 
7	I don't know . 
7	I don't know . I don't know . 
7	I don't know . I must think about it . 
7	I don't mean to be handing you no line , but that's pretty hard to believe . 
7	I don't mind it if you call me [PERSON] , you know . 
7	I don't see any native girls hungry for affection . 
7	I don't think I've seen you before . 
7	I don't think we have anything for you . 
7	I don't trust him . 
7	I don't understand what's going on today . 
7	I don't understand . You're already married . 
7	I don't want this ! 
7	I don't want to hear this ! 
7	I don't want to raise him by myself . 
7	I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that . 
7	I felt all warmed and funny inside . I can't describe it . 
7	I find this hard to say without sounding condescending , but I'm proud of you . 
7	I forgot who I was . 
7	I get this he runs a good operation " shit . " 
7	I get twice the work done around here . - You know why ? 
7	I got a gift for you . 
7	I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow And lived to tell about it . 
7	I guess [PERSON]'s got more sense than both of us . 
7	I guess that's why the old man gave it to you ! 
7	I had no idea ! 
7	I had trouble getting back to the sub . 
7	I hadn't heard you'd sold the place . 
7	I hadn't heard . I'm sorry . 
7	I have been thinking about you . Really ? 
7	I have defeated you ? 
7	I have to go now . 
7	I haven't been up this early in years . 
7	I haven't seen you around their office , though . 
7	I haven't seen you for a week . 
7	I haven't seen you for days . 
7	I headed into the English old country Looking for help . 
7	I hope you don't mind my asking , and , believe me , I'm thrilled that you did , but why did you accept a blind date ? 
7	I hope you like clowns . 
7	I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead . 
7	I just didn't believe it . 
7	I just got wised up to something funny the last few days . 
7	I just had the weirdest dream . 
7	I just happen to be taking the same train . 
7	I just saved your life , and you still don't trust me ? 
7	I killed this person for their money , right ? 
7	I knew it all along though , didn't I ? What else it is new , right ? 
7	I knew there'd be a catch to this . 
7	I know him . 
7	I know , [PERSON] , but ... 
7	I like him so much . 
7	I like the bubble . - Yeah ? 
7	I love this car . 
7	I made a special effort to not look like a nurse . 
7	I mean , if our system wasn't any good , why did they take us over in the first place , right ? 
7	I mean , jeez ... 
7	I might do that . 
7	I must have been crazy . 
7	I must have been crazy . 
7	I never imagined what was a work for woman . 
7	I never know in advance when I'm going to be a genius . 
7	I never mentioned any illness . 
7	I never mentioned any illness . 
7	I never scouted this neighborhood . 
7	I never thought I'd make it . 
7	I never thought of it ... 
7	I never thought of that , sir . 
7	I never wrote it . 
7	I noticed an enormous difference between [PERSON]'s projected figures and the ones off the extro - budget in the [LOCATION] market . 
7	I refuse to answer that question . 
7	I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask . 
7	I request a recess . 
7	I said , Are you fucking crazy ? " " 
7	I said , [PERSON] , you're already married . 
7	I saw it , but I didn't believe it . 
7	I saw the same book in her room . 
7	I see that it's funny . 
7	I see you're as adept at breaking into houses as you are into cars , [PERSON] . 
7	I see . So what do we do now ? 
7	I sent you all those letters . 
7	I shall not translate . 
7	I should be back in [LOCATION] , sitting in front of a typewriter , making all this up for a movie . 
7	I sit here and I can't believe that it happened . 
7	I swear I didn't know . 
7	I think my cook has managed guess what I like . 
7	I think so . Sure . Um ... 
7	I think that I'm pretty enough , but I would not want to be that kind of star . 
7	I though you didn't like blood sports . 
7	I thought communications were out . 
7	I thought he didn't drink . 
7	I thought he didn't have any trusted friends except you . 
7	I thought he was kidding . 
7	I thought he was sick . 
7	I thought I gave you plenty of time to ... 
7	I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you . 
7	I thought I liked to party , but these guys ... 
7	I thought I was doing smart business . 
7	I thought I was someone who I wasn't . 
7	I thought I'd lost the ability . With you , I. ... 
7	I thought it was all over . 
7	I thought it was all over . 
7	I thought it was the old man's 
7	I thought politics interested you . 
7	I thought that was you . 
7	I thought they said they was from [LOCATION] . 
7	I thought they were with [PERSON] . 
7	I thought you didn't -- 
7	I thought you said she got on the helicopter . 
7	I thought you said something . 
7	I thought you said that they transferred him . 
7	I thought you was dead . 
7	I thought you were a confirmed private . 
7	I thought you were fast asleep . 
7	I thought you were getting fatter , Mama ! 
7	I thought you were supposed to eat fish on a Friday . 
7	I thought you were ... 
7	I thought you weren't a romantic . 
7	I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow . 
7	I thought you wouldn't see [PERSON] now you're back with [PERSON] . 
7	I thought you'd be happy . 
7	I thought you'd be old . 
7	I thought you'd be onto me if anyone was . " " 
7	I thought you'd be thrilled to death . 
7	I thought you'd be thrilled to death . 
7	I thought you'd gone . 
7	I thought you'd question him . 
7	I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing . 
7	I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing . 
7	I thought your favourite was chicken . 
7	I thought your little cousin was going to sell the stock . 
7	I took a valium . Feel like I'm drunk . 
7	I turned pro at and I had eight fights . 
7	I understand perfectly . 
7	I understand ! You're provoking me into hitting you 
7	I want one ! Cuts along on a jolly clip too , doesn't she ?

7	I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 , acres . 
7	I was astonished at the extent of his reputation . 
7	I was just calling because I'm having a game night . 
7	I was kind of expecting a shit show . 
7	I was lucky I come across her last . 
7	I wasn't looking where I was going . 
7	I wasn't there when he died . 
7	I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] . 
7	I wonder what he's got against the marines ? 
7	I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect . 
7	I work with a junkie ? 
7	I would like to proudly present the newest member of the [PERSON] family , [PERSON] ! 
7	I wouldn't have believed it . 
7	I wouldn't think of such a thing ! 
7	I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again . 
7	I'd always heard how badass you Grimms were , but your mother was a complete letdown . 
7	I'd have to lead them through . 
7	I'd offer you something harder , but you don't drink ? 
7	I'll be damned . 
7	I'll be surprised . What about years ? 
7	I'll listen , but I can't guarantee how long . 
7	I'm actually beginning to like them . 
7	I'm always getting winked at these days . 
7	I'm dreaming !

7	I'm sorry , ma'am , but you're needed in the Situation Room . 
7	I'm surprised at you ! 
7	I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday . 
7	I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan . 
7	I've been called a lot of things , but " comfortable " ! 
7	I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] . 
7	I've been looking everywhere for you . 
7	I've looked all over for shoes like that . 
7	I've never been invisible before . 
7	I've never done anything like that before in my life .

7	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ? 
7	If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ... 
7	If he is to be sacrificed before [PERSON] , why is he not painted red ? 
7	If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do . 
7	If I hadn't seen you on the news , I wouldn't have known who his partner was . 
7	If I'd only known , I'd have come straight home . 
7	If I'd only known , I'd have come straight home . 
7	If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ? 
7	If not [PERSON] , who is it ? 
7	If that's all what we all thinking , why isn't someone just come right out and say it ? 
7	If this guy has any information , why hasn't he contacted you already ? 
7	If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ? 
7	If you become president , would [PERSON] remain as vice president ? 
7	If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress . 
7	If you don't , somebody else will . 
7	If you find any keys , hang on to them . 
7	Impossible ! 
7	In charge of piers and warehouses ?

7	Isn't there a guard ? 
7	Isn't this a school day ? 
7	Isn't this about professionalism ? 
7	Isn't this the same desk ... ? 
7	It astonished me . 
7	It hurts ! 
7	It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is . 
7	It is infernal ! 
7	It is nothing like we figured out . 
7	It is to you and you that my name means nothing . 
7	It is too expensive to maintain , [PERSON] ! 
7	It isn't that . It's what [PERSON] said . 
7	It looks better on you . 
7	It looks different here . 
7	It means I got my own lead . I saw a guy in the bar a couple of hours ago .

7	It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing . 
7	It took me a week to find this crap . 
7	It turns out that [PERSON] , in his early career , actually spoke and wrote about UFOs in a way that was affirmative , that was legitimate . 
7	It was certainly a heart attack ! 
7	It was fine . You've been away all this time ? 
7	It was just ... something happened that ... hasn't happened in like years . 
7	It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out . 
7	It was really hard . 
7	It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody . 
7	It was them ! They sent it ! 
7	It was , uh , bound in human flesh , inked in blood . 
7	It wasn't even loaded .
