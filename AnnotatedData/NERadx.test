3	It's me , you fool . 
3	It's no use anyway . 
3	It's not going to go that far . 
3	It's not like they'll miss it . 
3	It's not right to leave it in there . 
3	It's not that easy to kill someone and get away with it .

3	It's people who should be blamed for the filth , not the river . 
3	It's pretty awful . 
3	It's such a ridiculous ...

3	Junior's gonna be a convict before he's in third grade ! 
3	Just a man with a poor taste in beers . 
3	Just another white guy waiting for the train . 
3	Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy . 
3	Just because it is big and white and a yacht , is it not still dirt ?

3	Kind of reckless of you . 
3	Kirk , [PERSON] has made a chump out of you . 
3	Knew we'd be too obsessed by the perpetrator inside the bank to see much more than a beard or a blond or a whiny jerk . What do you got ? 
3	[LOCATION] is up for grabs , the spoils of our once fine city going to the ruthless scum who can spread the most carnage and blood in our streets .

3	Maybe she even killed my partner , [PERSON] . 
3	Maybe you can hear this . The next time you cross me , you're gonna turn up missing . 
3	Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client . 
3	Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too , or maybe he doesn't want to know . 
3	Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better . 
3	[PERSON] , I don't mind you being stupid , but this is crazy .

3	Never return to [LOCATION] . 
3	Never ! 
3	Next time you try that , I'll forget that you're a woman . 
3	Nice tits , sure , But a face I wouldn't want to Wipe my feet on . 
3	[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] . 
3	No case ? Your client put a faulty train on those tracks , people died , and they knew it could happen the whole time . 
3	No doubt the fellow is an impostor . 
3	No doubt the fellow is an impostor . 
3	No further questions . 
3	No man , woman or beast will ever desire you again . 
3	No matter how many you kill here you still won't save the kingdom The emperor is surrounded by sycophants and has no idea of the suffering of his people 
3	No morality ? 
3	No more soap opera . 
3	No need to mock the grave . 
3	No need to shove ! 
3	No way in hell . 
3	No , don't do it . 
3	No , get away from her you fucking old bitch ! 
3	No , he has other things to do than spend his money on stupid things 
3	No , I don't like it . 
3	No , my colleagues and I didn't find Captain [PERSON] a perfect officer . 
3	No , no , I will not go crawling back to that woman 
3	No , no , no . lt's Saturday night , man . 
3	No , no , no . Shit . 
3	No , no . - No interference from us , right ? 
3	No , not today . 
3	No , not tonight . 
3	No , [PERSON] likes vulgar women . 
4	I'm not sure how to operate that thing . 
4	I'm not surprised . Me , too . 
4	I'm peeing my pants . 
4	I'm scared . 
4	I'm scared . 
4	I'm shaky . 
4	I'm shocked . 
4	I'm so afraid for you . 
4	I'm so scared my bones are clicking , like dice on a [PERSON] crap table . 
4	I'm sorry for what happened . 
4	I'm sorry , I just made a mistake . 
4	I'm sorry . 
4	I'm sorry . 
4	I'm sorry . 
4	I'm telling you , sir , you've got to put a stop to him now . 
4	I'm the one that left you that note today . That's so strange . 
4	I'm through making mistakes . 
4	I'm trapped , [LOCATION] . 
4	I'm trapped . 
4	I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan . 
4	I'm worried about the future , and what people will think . 
4	I'm . . I no m. . mean to . 
4	I've been doing just that for years , until [PERSON] walked into my shop last week . 
4	I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] . 
4	I've been robbed . 
4	I've been robbed . 
4	I've got a little problem . 
4	I've got every man on it , but without FBI or locals , we're carrying a handicap . 
4	I've got to get out before he gets back ! 
4	I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story , but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government ! 
4	I've just been bitten by a snake . 
4	I've just heard a startling piece of news . 
4	I've just heard a startling piece of news . 
4	I've no other place to go . 
4	I've only got hours . 
4	I've put the gun down . 
4	I've , uh , really enjoyed this little chat . 
4	If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ? 
4	If anyone looks like they know you ... 
4	If [PERSON] sees a phone company subpoena , now , she'll bust a gut . 
4	If he found out , he'd insist upon doing it himself if he had the money , which I doubt . 
4	If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out ! 
4	If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out ! 
4	If I give them any trouble , they cut me . 
4	If I go , you'll ruin me . 
4	If I let go , I'll fall ! 
4	If I miss that meeting , I'll lose about half next year's sales commissions . 
4	If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify before the grand jury ... It could destroy my reputation . 
4	If I'm not on guard every moment , you steal across the border into reality . 
4	If it was in all states , not good . 
4	If it was the Royals , I'd be dead right now . 
4	If it wouldn't be too much trouble . 
4	If [PERSON]'s found dead , that'll make for more questions and deeper probes . 
4	If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ? 
4	If one of them followed you , there's got to be more of them around . 
4	If she succeeds , the consequences will be disastrous . 
4	If that's true , we were guilty . 
4	If the city can pay , we'll be humiliated . 
4	If the strychnine was not in the coffee and we know that it was not in the cocoa , where it was ? 
4	If they find out you're FBI , we have a problem . 
4	If they track you down , it wouldn't be our doing . 
4	If things don't work out ... 
4	If we close , our stock won't be worth a nickel . 
4	If we close , our stock won't be worth a nickel . 
4	If we didn't have a price on our heads , we'd get out of this hole . 
4	If we do this , we're in trouble . 
4	If we don't get that money , how's [PERSON] gonna go to seattle ? 
4	If we keep our stern to the wind , we'll roll over . 
4	If we let him live , could he forgive us ? 
4	If we lose , get out of town quick . 
4	If we push this , who are we pushing against ? 
4	If we quit , some Federal judge take away your money . 
4	If we screw up graduation , we'll have to take basics all over again . 
4	If we yield to blackmail from this man , we'll become a laughing stock ! 
4	If we yield to blackmail from this man , we'll become a laughing stock ! 
4	If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory , it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage . 
4	If you bleed , you'll get an infection . 
4	If you do that you'll get nothing , except maybe the police after you . 
4	If you don't find [PERSON]'s killer , we are both history . 
4	If you don't hurry ... 
4	If you drop any charges against [PERSON] , we'll drop the lawsuit against you . 
4	If you know where she is , I beg you to tell me now before it's too late . 
4	If you print anything now , I'll be exposed . 
4	If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project , this bullet has your name on it , and it will find you . 
4	If you want him to die , shoot now . 
4	If you're guides there , I'll kill your family . 
4	If you're standing where [PERSON] was , you're gonna drown . 
4	Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in . 
4	In hours every hit man in [LOCATION] will be here . I seriously doubt that . 
4	In a shootout , five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ... 
4	In fact I should . 
4	In the dream , the destroyer's destroyed . 
4	In the meantime , I'll be dead . 
4	In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships . 
4	Inside there's a huge creature 
4	[LOCATION]'s been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there . 
4	Is anybody hurt ? 
4	Is anyone down there ? 
4	Is he all right ? 
4	Is he dead ? 
4	Is he dead ? 
4	Is he gonna be a problem ? 
4	Is he gonna be okay ? 
4	Is it bleeding ? 
4	Is it worth the risk of a scandal ? 
4	Is it worth the risk of a scandal ? 
4	Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ? 
4	Is [PERSON] really dead ? 
4	Is Mommy going to be all right ? 
4	Is something wrong ? 
4	Is there no a door of another side ? 
4	[PERSON] . [PERSON] , are you all right ? 
4	Isn't it possible that some sort of external intelligence , some discarnate entity , has crossed into our plane of existence ? 
4	Isn't [PERSON]'s death enough ? 
4	Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk ? 
4	Isn't that terrible ! 
4	Isn't the reverse possible ? 
4	It ain't safe to go that way ... 
4	It all began one night when the lights went out. , 
4	It can only blow up in our faces . 
4	It can't be a coincidence it lays out this way , [PERSON] . 
4	It concerns me ! 
4	It could break us financially . 
4	It could get you in trouble . 
4	It could have been a dead end . 
4	It could still come back at any time 
4	It couldn't have been me , sir . 
4	It doesn't fear my incantations ! 
4	It don't hurt having ' an angel on your side . 
4	It don't look good , Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one . 
4	It felt like an earthquake . 
4	It hurts ! 
4	It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood , in every city and state in the country . 
4	It is being covered up , but , probably not for the reasons you might think . 
4	It is he . 
4	It is infernal ! 
4	It is spoken on all channels . 
4	It is the monster ! 
4	It kills many brave men . 
4	It looks like a life sentence . 
4	It makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone . 
4	It may bring you serious trouble . 
4	It may bring you serious trouble . 
4	It may endanger the very peace and stability of [LOCATION] . 
4	It means , um ... if you say anything about this , - your ass is grass . - Okay . 
4	It might get infected . 
4	It must be serious . 
4	It put the rope to the neck ! 
4	It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing . 
4	It sounds frightening . 
4	It sounds to me like you have an agenda . 
4	It tried to kill my Raymond ! 
4	It was a nightmare . 
4	It was an accident . 
4	It was an accident . 
4	It was an avalanche . 
4	It was horrible there . 
4	It was just ... something happened that ... hasn't happened in like years . 
4	It was really hard . 
4	It wasn't her fault , honest it wasn't . 
4	It wasn't her fault , honest it wasn't . 
4	It will be difficult for me . Suppose ... 
4	It will get me in much trouble . " " 
4	It will make them sick . 
4	It ... it's gonna be okay . 
4	It'll get cold . 
4	It'll only get you in trouble . 
4	It'll probably kill me , too . 
4	It's a big mistake . 
4	It's a cruel disease . 
4	It's a damn nightmare . 
4	It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners . 
4	It's a matter of life and death ! 
4	It's a matter of life and death . 
4	It's a matter of life and death . 
4	It's a monster ! 
4	It's a passion that continues to grow , ... The more the King is drowning . 
4	It's a shark ! 
4	It's a train robbery . 
4	It's a trap . 
4	It's a wonder we make a profit at all . 
4	It's all been like a crazy nightmare . 
4	It's all been like a crazy nightmare . 
4	It's all coming apart , Al. 
4	It's all right , don't shoot ! 
4	It's already on the : news . 
4	It's awfully quaint , isn't it ? 
4	It's bad there . 
4	It's bad . 
4	It's black smoke . 
4	It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country . 
4	It's dangerous . 
4	It's difficult holding her . 
4	It's going to be a disaster . 
4	It's gonna be a massacre . 
4	It's gonna be a treacherous hike . 
4	It's gonna take some getting used to , isn't it ? 
4	It's her ! 
4	It's horrible . 
4	It's just that ... the breeding is no longer working . 
4	It's just when you say these things are closing in on me , it's like a nightmare . 
4	It's just -- it's hard sometimes . 
4	It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't -- He don't know why we're here . 
4	It's like having a beast ... wild within me , 
4	It's like that time in [LOCATION] when he made me walk ... stripped down to only my long - handles and my hat . 
4	It's like that time in [LOCATION] when he made me walk ... stripped down to only my long - handles and my hat . 
4	It's like they're after me , right ? 
4	It's looking for us . 
4	It's not an easy thing to do . 
4	It's not enough . 
4	It's not going to be a problem , is it , [PERSON] ? 
4	It's not going to be easy . 
4	It's not like that . 
4	It's not mine , man . 
4	It's not right to leave it in there . 
4	It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out . 
4	It's not safe . 
4	It's not what you think . I - I - I would never ... Please , [PERSON] . 
4	It's only temporary , you know ? 
4	It's over . 
4	It's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded . 
4	It's something I couldn't discuss with anyone . 
4	It's three years since my last confession . 
4	It's ticking like a bomb . 
4	It's too dangerous , it's utterly unpredictable . 
4	It's too late to start anything now . 
4	It's too late , isn't it ? 
4	It's too late , isn't it ? 
4	It's too late . 
4	It's too risky . 
4	It's too young for a heart attack . 
4	It's urgent ! 
4	It's you . 
4	It's your gun , sir ? 
4	[PERSON] , I warn you . 
4	[PERSON] could be killed . 
4	Japs !

4	Just in case . 
4	Just look at her . Look at the size of her . 
4	Just look at me . I can't get through that jungle . 
4	Just please help us . 
4	Just promise me you'll see a doctor as soon as you get there , okay ? 
4	Just throw our hats in the air . 
4	Just wait till he's looking down your throat , that's all . 
4	Keep it down , you'll wake the munchkins ! 
4	Keep your head down , hotshot !

5	I'm sure glad we've run into you . 
5	I'm sure I can do it . 
5	I'm sure that in all [LOCATION] there's no empathicalist as charming as you . 
5	I'm sure that's thanks to you as well . 
5	I'm sure you'll be glad to know that law and order has come to [LOCATION] . 
5	I'm taking a bath . 
5	I'm taking a bath . 
5	I'm taking over the bridge . 
5	I'm telling you , it's gonna be all right . 
5	I'm the funny one . 
5	I'm thinking about my own ass . 
5	I'm thinking about showing him and getting pregnant . Of course if I get pregnant I can't go to FATI . 
5	I'm very fond of my wife and kid . 
5	I'm very happy to know you , sir . 
5	I'm very happy to know you , sir . 
5	I'm very pleased to meet you , sister [PERSON] . 
5	I'm willing to keep the conversation going , - but in the meantime ... 
5	I'm with you . 
5	I'm worth the risk , you'll see . 
5	I've a great program to try out . 
5	I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates . 
5	I've always been in love with you . 
5	I've been building a reputation for years . 
5	I've been building a reputation for 25 , years . 
5	I've been missing you a lot lately . 
5	I've been sleeping with women . 
5	I've come to get you - it's my party . 
5	I've escaped ! 
5	I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels . 
5	I've got a plan . 
5	I've got cookies ! 
5	I've got some good wine . 
5	I've got some sandwiches in my pack . 
5	I've got something down here . 
5	I've got tons of exotic destinations , faraway places , custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway . 
5	I've got you the assignment of your dreams ! 
5	I've had a lot of fun , [PERSON] , I saw some shows , went to nightclubs . 
5	I've had enough , thanks . 
5	I've looked all over for shoes like that . 
5	I've never been happier in my life . 
5	I've never felt more alive in my whole life . 
5	I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are . 
5	I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are . 
5	I've told you that he is what other men are not . 
5	If [PERSON]'s a good boy , he gets the jackpot . 
5	If he likes running his fingers through my hair , well , why not ? 
5	If he made it , so can I ! 
5	If I see you in the stands , it make me feel better . 
5	If I use my last wish ... 
5	If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that . 
5	If it's so beautiful down there , why ... 
5	If there was a bum within miles , I was completely attracted to him . 
5	If we can force them to come in and face us , we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape . 
5	If you did your cheekbones better , you could look like [PERSON] . 
5	If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress . 
5	If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress . 
5	If you need to take a break , you can . 
5	If you start to hesitate , call me . 
5	If you worked for the imperial court your future would be boundless 
5	If your mother were alive , she'd be so happy . 
5	In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . 
5	In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . 
5	In case I want to read it more than once . 
5	In fact , I admire the style of you . 
5	In fact , I'm just about to haul nuggies . 
5	In my dreams I saw a light over [LOCATION] and I knew there was hope . 
5	In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless , graceful harmony . 
5	In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit . 
5	In the final analysis , all we're trying to do is create a happy world . 
5	In the garden of a convent in [LOCATION] , there's a beautiful statue . 
5	In the last two years of his life , he gave away most of his fortune ... in large , anonymous donations , to your charity . 
5	In the summertime , at sunset , the whole beach looks incredible . 
5	In this business , one should joke a little . 
5	Is her lover . He comes over . 
5	Is it not fortunate , for instance , that I own the newspapers in my country ? 
5	Is it ... and look who's there ! 
5	Is that a fine - lookin' woman or what ? 
5	Is this a beautiful castle ? 
5	Isabelle ! 
5	[PERSON] . [PERSON] ! It's finished . 
5	Isabelle ... I. . . I need you . 
5	Isn't it divine ? 
5	Isn't it marvellous ?

5	Isn't it wonderful ? 
5	Isn't she gorgeous ? 
5	Isn't she pretty ? 
5	Isn't technology wonderful ? 
5	Isn't that amazing ? 
5	Isn't that an intriguing challenge ? 
5	Isn't that extraordinary ? 
5	Isn't that her dancing with that nice - looking young fellow over there ? 
5	Isn't that pretty ? 
5	Isn't that wonderful , father ? 
5	Isn't that wonderful , father ? 
5	Isn't that wonderful ?

5	Isn't that wonderful ? 
5	Isn't this exciting ? 
5	Isn't this fun ? 
5	Isn't this just fabulous ? 
6	I'll never get this . We're doomed ! 
6	I'll never have a girl like that " 
6	I'll never see you again . 
6	I'll start weeping with self - pity any minute . 
6	I'm a sex trafficking survivor . 
6	I'm a sick man . 
6	I'm a sick man . 
6	I'm a three - time loser , [PERSON] . 
6	I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn . 
6	I'm afraid I'm not a very good host . 
6	I'm afraid I've disappointed you . 
6	I'm afraid it's all my fault . 
6	I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot . 
6	I'm afraid the press has been alerted to your mother's presence here ... - ... and her arrest . - Oh , great . 
6	I'm afraid we lost our patient .

6	I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud . 
6	I'm not lying . 
6	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting . 
6	I'm not playing at being provost marshal . And I never heard of luck that didn't run out . 
6	I'm not ready to retire yet . 
6	I'm not ready to retire yet . 
6	I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog . 
6	I'm not sure how much good all this talking's doing . 
6	I'm not surprised . Me , too . 
6	I'm not usually this fragile . 
6	I'm not very good at that . 
6	I'm obsolescing like this old straw - bottomed cruiser of ours . 
6	I'm out of my mind ? 
6	I'm peeing my pants . 
6	I'm really not sure .

6	I'm sorry to hear that , Lady Fingers . 
6	I'm sorry to hear that , Mr. [PERSON] . 
6	I'm sorry to hear that .

6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . 
6	I'm sorry . I'm just frustrated . 
6	I'm sorry . I'm sorry . 
6	I'm supposed to be taking care of you . 
6	I'm sure you don't mean that . 
6	I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail . 
6	I'm talking too much . 
6	I'm telling you , I thought I was the best . 
6	I'm telling you , I thought I was the best . 
6	I'm terribly sorry . 
6	I'm the last installment and that troubles me . 
6	I'm tired of being only three inches high . 
6	I'm tired . 
6	I'm too old to be traded in . 
6	I'm too tired . 
6	I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn . 
6	I'm trying , you know it really upsets me . 
6	I'm unhappy . 
6	I'm very sorry about that , Miss.[LOCATION] . . 
6	I'm very sorry about that , Miss.[LOCATION] . . 
6	I'm very upset , [PERSON] . 
6	I'm ... I'm sorry . 
6	I've been aboard the [PERSON] too long . 
6	I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again . 
6	I've been having weather problems . 
6	I've been in all night . 
6	I've been missing you a lot lately . 
6	I've been sick , [PERSON] . 
6	I've been stuck here for 20 , years . 
6	I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out . 
6	I've been trying to find you , but ... 
6	I've even ... Maybe you won't admit it , but you love me . - [PERSON] . 
6	I've got a headache , [PERSON] . 
6	I've got a scar . 
6	I've got bad news for you , GJ . 
6	I've got to go to [LOCATION] , first plane . 
6	I've had a very trying evening . 
6	I've had a very trying evening . 
6	I've had the flu . 
6	I've lied and used people all my life because I thought everybody did . 
6	I've lost , pounds on the horses . 
6	I've missed so much ! 
6	I've never been dumped before , that ... didn't feel awesome . 
6	I've never before known anyone who was really brave . 
6	I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today . 
6	I've never tried to kill myself successfully . 
6	I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years . 
6	I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years . 
6	If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her . 
6	If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do . 
6	If I could only close my eyes for a few hours . 
6	If I spoke , you barely answered . 
6	If I told you what we've been through ... 
6	If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here . 
6	If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of , I would be willing to share all this ... My records , everything . 
6	If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ? 
6	If only I'd done a better job . 
6	If she was young and beautiful , I forgive you . 
6	If that's true , we were guilty . 
6	If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do . 
6	If the city can pay , we'll be humiliated . 
6	If there was a bum within miles , I was completely attracted to him . 
6	If there were more time ... 
6	If we could be like this forever it would be great 
6	If we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers . 
6	If you die , your type will be extinct 
6	If you don't eat and sleep , you have to expect accidents like that . 
6	If you would've had four fours , you would've won . 
6	Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles . 
6	Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles . 
6	In a shootout , five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ... 
6	In fact , we're so bad that we're disbanding . 
6	In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap . 
6	In the end , we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet . 
6	In the last century , the islanders were starving . 
6	In your world if The Neverending Story is fading no child will ever know about Junior . 
6	Is he dead ? 
6	Is he gonna be okay ? 
6	Is it all gone ? 
6	Is it that you think it'll be better for ... for all of us if you go away ? 
6	Is [PERSON] really dead ? 
6	Is not no one , who could take care of him ? 
6	Is that it ? 
6	Is there no justice in the world ? 
6	Is this the kind of person that you are ? 
6	Isn't that what's wrong with the world today ? 
6	It adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I've become a little sentimental . 
6	It affects her every day . 
6	It ain't all that easy , son .... 
6	It breaks my heart . 
6	It could break us financially . 
6	It could work if the government would spend more money . 
6	It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now . 
6	It does matter . 
6	It doesn't happen often these days . 
6	It doesn't have to be like this . 
6	It doesn't make sense . 
6	It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth . 
6	It drags at your heart till ... you can't do anything but look back . 
6	It drags at your heart till ... you can't do anything but look back . 
6	It ended very badly . 
6	It forces me to beg as a beggar . 
6	It gives me a terrible pain . 
6	It hasn't been all that pleasant for you , has it Mr. [PERSON] ? 
6	It hasn't been easy , has it ? 
6	It hurts a little . 
6	It hurts me when people laugh at you . 
6	It hurts , but he doesn't show it . 
6	It hurts , hurts , hurts . 
6	It is not a pivotal project in your career . 
6	It is not the one . 
6	It is probable that the last dose is fatal . 
6	It is to you and you that my name means nothing . 
6	It is too expensive to maintain , [PERSON] ! 
6	It isn't like it used to be . 
6	It isn't that . It's what [PERSON] said . 
6	It made her sick . 
6	It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be . 
6	It makes me sad . 
6	It makes my heart sad . 
6	It must be a mistake , he was clever ... 
6	It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful . 
6	It seems I try to do the impossible . 
6	It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] . 
6	It sometimes never goes away . How you talk . 
6	It takes away the pain . 
6	It was awful ! 
6	It was blocking him from coming out . 
6	It was certainly a heart attack ! 
7	It's all here . 
7	It's an incredibly profitable , as horrifying as it is to say , business . 
7	It's an investment ? 
7	It's as if ordinary human beings , living ordinary lives , had suddenly vanished from the [LOCATION] , and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people . 
7	It's back ! 
7	It's been over a week you've been gone . 
7	It's been ... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work . 
7	It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses , the more it makes , because of the carryovers with the write - offs . 
7	It's funny , she didn't mention a husband . 
7	It's getting real bright out here . 
7	It's hard to believe about [PERSON] . 
7	It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 , years . 
7	It's hard to believe , isn't it ? 
7	It's her ! 
7	It's impossible ! 
7	It's impossible . [PERSON] ... 
7	It's impossible . Now time is up , [LOCATION]'s doing it's audit . 
7	It's incredible stupidity ... 
7	It's just beginner's luck . 
7	It's just me . 
7	It's like they're running an errand , and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand . 
7	It's [PERSON] ! [PERSON] from [LOCATION] . 
7	It's me , [PERSON] . 
7	It's more than my job's worth ! 
7	It's not all a lie , [PERSON] . 
7	It's portable , long - range , very expensive . 
7	It's somehow able to bend light . 
7	It's the first time he's told me the truth ! 
7	It's unbelievable . 
7	It's working . 
7	[PERSON] could be killed . 
7	Jeanne ! 
7	[PERSON] , aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry ? 
7	Jesus christ , man . 
7	[PERSON] , what happened ? 
7	[PERSON] ! Murderer ! 
7	Jesus Christ . 
7	[PERSON] fucking christ . - $ ? - Yes , sir . 
7	[PERSON] , I wondered who ate these damn things . 
7	[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances ! 
7	[PERSON] , this is a fairly young guy . 
7	Jesus ! 
7	Jesus ! 
7	Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch . 
7	[PERSON] , are we leaving ? 
7	[PERSON] ... ? 
7	Joséphine ? 
7	Judge , it's our theory that Mr. [PERSON] is being framed in this case . 
7	Judges need to be educated , the public needs to be educated , the Department of Justice needs to be educated on exactly what's going on here . 
7	[PERSON] does not get on that helicopter with the Royals . Instead she goes over to [PERSON]'s house and tries to kill him ? 
7	Junior when are you going to learn the difference between a rock and a nose ? 
7	Just because it is big and white and a yacht , is it not still dirt ? 
7	Just look at her . Look at the size of her . 
7	Just one ? 
7	Just what is this relationship between you and our friend ? 
7	Just when I think you're dead , you always come back . 
7	Ka - rumph ! We were smashed to port . 
7	Kelly's dead ? 
7	[PERSON] didn't even look at me . 
7	knots through the harbour ? 
7	[PERSON] , he shouldn't be up here . 
7	l pumped your stomach . Oh , God . 
7	Lacy , watch out ! 
7	Ladies , I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros . 
7	[PERSON] ? 
7	Leader , party just got bigger . 
7	LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED , UNDRESS , SHOWER , BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED 
7	Leon , why are you so good to us ? 
7	Leon , why are you so good to us ? 
7	Let me give you this watch . 
7	Let me have secrets . 
7	Let me in ! Let me in ! 
7	Let's just time [PERSON] as he comes charging to the rescue ! - What's going on here ? 
7	Let's not get carried away here . 
7	Let's put this on your wrist . What is that ? Ok , this is a digital heart monitor . 
7	Lieutenant , what the hell is that thing ? 
7	Like [PERSON] lost control ? 
7	Like one time , I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked , except he still had his socks on . 
7	Like what ? 
7	Like your shoes , it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did . 
7	Listen to this , there were some hard drives in the copy store that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer . 
7	Listen , today is my birthday and the girls give me a party . 
7	[PERSON] ? 
7	Look at all that underwear . 
7	Look at all these happy families . 
7	Look at you , baby girl ! Hey , you ready to blow this joint or what ? 
7	Look at your eyes ! 
7	Look how big it is ! 
7	Look how I've changed ! 
7	Look out below ! 
7	Look what just came in . 
7	Look what's in the street . 
7	Look who's here . 
7	Look who's here . 
7	Look , a fist ! 
7	Look , I won ! 
7	Look , it's [PERSON] ! 
7	Look , look , this would be the greatest discovery in the history of science . 
7	Look , money ! 
7	Look , money ! 
7	Look , you can't dwell on what you hoped was gonna happen with [PERSON] . 
7	Look ! 
7	Look . Look ! Look ! 
7	Looks a lot like your house , doesn't it ? 
7	Looks like he's in great shape , don't he ? 
7	Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh . - Dress it . Quickly . 
7	Looks like we got a slumber party on the third floor . 
7	Looks like we're going that way . 
7	Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] ! 
7	[PERSON] , don't you have your own secretary ? 
7	lt was [PERSON] . - How do you - l tailed him . 
7	Lucito , huh ? 
7	Mac ... 
7	Madame is canceling the engagement ? 
7	Madame is canceling the engagement ? 
7	Madame , if you don't think about food , what do you think about ? 
7	Magic ? 
7	Majesty I can present ... my young daughter , the new Countess of [PERSON] ? 
7	Make your wish . 
7	Man , he is a lot bigger . 
7	Man , I always thought it was the mezcal talking , but after seeing this , I think he was right . 
7	Many of you aren't wearing battle gear . 
7	[PERSON] , nice to meet you . 
7	[PERSON] -[PERSON] , how do you do ? 
7	[PERSON]'s no one's friend . 
7	Mark : There's a big wind coming ! 
7	[PERSON] has disappeared . 
7	Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour . 
7	[PERSON] , you must be mistaken . 
7	[PERSON] , you must be mistaken . 
7	Maybe he'd better start carrying his own matches . Oh ? 
7	Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't . 
7	Maybe I should just go back to the clinic ? 
7	Maybe it's me and [PERSON] . 
7	Maybe she has a sister . 
7	Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids . 
7	Maybe they're buddies after all . 
7	Maybe you sleep together once in a while . 
7	Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too , or maybe he doesn't want to know . 
7	Me not work ? 
7	[PERSON] , are you OK ? 
7	[PERSON] , you're so ... weird ! 
7	Miss what ? 
7	Miss [PERSON] is going with you ? 
7	Mom . Nice to see you . - Hello . 
7	Mommy ! Mom ! 
7	[PERSON] , my man . 
7	More than two ? 
7	More ! - More ? 
7	Mother of God . [PERSON] ' dog ? - You said pig . 
7	Mr who ? 
7	Mr. [PERSON] ? It's been so long . I almost didn't recognize you . 
7	Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ? 
7	Mr. [PERSON]'s changed with the times . 
7	Mr. [PERSON] , do you think really that I could be a star ? 
7	Mr. [PERSON] knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question . 
7	Mr. [PERSON] , it seems that [PERSON]'s mother was murdered by [PERSON]'s father . 
7	Mr. [PERSON] wants to know how come he don't know you . 
7	Mrs [PERSON] , do you know what you just ordered ? 
7	Mrs. [PERSON] ! 
7	Ms. [PERSON] ... everybody has a secret face . 
7	Ms. [PERSON] , this is an outrageous situation . 
7	Must have been degrees to the shadow ! There was no a cloud in the sky . 
7	Must have been watching out that window for hours . 
7	My brother took all your cigarettes ? I have another pack . 
7	My club ? Really ? 
7	My God , he's done a wonderful job . 
7	My god , I am still in love you . 
7	My God ! 
7	My God . 
7	My goodness , you have such an attractive little garden here . 
7	My life is a surprise .

7	My word , are there important people downstairs ? 
7	My , and you did your spring house - cleaning all in one day . 
7	Nearly creamed us both . 
7	Never saw a man yet could hold his liquor like a bottle . 
7	Never tasted better . There's a fork on your left , Mr. Land ... 
7	Never , in any crisis of your life , have I known you to have a handkerchief . 
7	Never , in any crisis of your life , have I known you to have a handkerchief . 
7	Never , not even for a minute , I believed that you had been . 
7	Next thing you know , boom . 
7	Nice entrance . 
7	Nice work , [PERSON] . 
7	[PERSON] killed [PERSON] ? 
7	[PERSON] , that was your new partner . 
7	[PERSON] ! What the -- ? 
7	Ning ! 
7	Ninotchka , when we first went to my apartment ... did I have the slightest idea that you were connected with this deal ? 
7	No diapers ? 
7	No diaphragm in that lady . What happened to it ? 
7	No DNA found at the scene . 
7	No luck ? 
7	No one's ever gotten away with a stunt like this before . 
7	No , [PERSON] ! 
7	No , Dad , we adopted . 
7	No , for [PERSON] and [PERSON] . 
7	No , I don't even want to do that . 
7	No , I don't guess it is . 
7	No , I don't like it . 
7	No , it's just ... I read in this thing that's what I'm supposed to do . 
7	No , no , no , I don't mean that . 
7	No , no , they don't . 
7	No , not perhaps " . " 
7	No , not , [PERSON] .

7	No . Not the rangers . What'll I do ? 
7	No . This is [PERSON] . 
7	No . Well , I'll tell you what . 
7	No ... 
7	Nobody knows anything about what's happening here . 
7	Nobody's going to come looking for him ? 
7	[PERSON] equals [PERSON] . " This is [PERSON]'s handwriting . " 
7	Noise , what's that noise ? 
7	None of this was [PERSON]'s fault . 
7	Not an idiot ? 
7	Not bad for an old - timer , huh ? I'll say . 
7	Not even a perhaps or a maybe ? 
7	Not exactly funny , it's just that you're so different from your son . 
7	Not exactly . 
7	Not like a scientist , like an ... artist . 
7	Not [PERSON] ? 
7	Not the way it is . 
7	Not until you've finished . 
7	Not very hard , then . 
7	Not very lucky , is he ? 
7	Now he was going to pry it open . 
7	Now isn't that jolly ? 
7	Now let him win it back ! 
7	Now neither one of you are making sense . 
7	Now that hurts . Because this was my intention from the very beginning . 
7	Now that you mention it ... 
7	Now what makes you think I hate her ? 
7	Now what's all this ? 
7	Now you want to give him another ? 
7	Now , don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend . 
7	Now , that ... that would be unexpected . 
7	Now , that's original .

8	It's gonna be awkward , but this kid comes first . 
8	It's gonna be very dangerous . 
8	It's home .... 
8	It's in a car outside . 
8	It's just fear and priggishness to believe in limits . 
8	It's me and you . 
8	It's nice and clean in here . 
8	It's no big deal . 
8	It's no bluff . 
8	It's not too late . 
8	It's OK , I was thinking the same thing . 
8	It's OK . 
8	It's okay . 
8	It's okay . 
8	It's okay . It's mine . 
8	It's only temporary , you know ? 
8	It's out ! - Are you all right ? 
8	It's over . Water under the bridge . 
8	It's [PERSON] . I wanted to let you know - [PERSON] is set for tonight . 
8	It's portable , long - range , very expensive . 
8	It's safe , trust me . 
8	It's taken care of . 
8	It's time I faced up to what I do have to do . 
8	It's to show I love you . 
8	It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements . 
8	It's ... Not that big a deal . 
8	Jack to the king . 
8	[PERSON] , since you're not going on the cruise , I could use you at the store on Monday . 
8	Jesus . Yes , this is me . 
8	[PERSON] , you got to trust me . 
8	[PERSON] knows what the men want . 
8	Judge , you said we would be entitled to some leeway ...

8	Just do it . 
8	Just give me a sign .
