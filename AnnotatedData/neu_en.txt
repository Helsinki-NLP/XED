9	Yeah I was just telling him.
9	Two pair 10s and sixes.
9	There's more where that came from.
9	Mr. Howard sir.
9	One moment please.
9	Or any place!
9	Well because that makes sense.
9	Last card.
9	I fold.
9	Not very lucky is he?
9	I figure to call his shot when I turn my back.
9	I can't beat three sevens.
9	A dead man has one half-hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
9	Who?
9	Killing Sir Harry put the kibosh on the whole slaughterhouse right?
9	Until morning that is.
9	Give me that gun.
9	Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.
9	Where you been?
9	William Jefferson Slade.
9	And I can't get started.
9	I jack it up and get whipped on both sides.
9	They've been worse.
9	But don't let that fool you.
9	Love is not blind.
9	I suppose it's more a matter of climate than anything else.
9	Doctor.
9	Pair of eights.
9	That is undoubtedly true.
9	Calvary Pinkertons...
9	Look this is the Wolf City Tribune of two days ago.
9	Five thousand to you Pig.
9	Strawn!
9	What happened to your coat?
9	What about what I said?
9	What then?
9	May I offer you something to drink Trixie?
9	Ain't much you can do about us.
9	That's maybe 1000 $2000?
9	He's a percentage player.
9	You go find it.
9	No I had something to eat in town.
9	I'm gonna be...
9	Where's Shelleen?
9	He owns Wolf City Development which owns Wolf City... which lets us alone.
9	Oh yeah?
9	Not yet.
9	Take it easy Pig.
9	My plan?
9	Too long.
9	Got you for 110 a 60 and an 85.
9	Hoban?
9	Yeah?
9	You're like all the rest of them you gotta be in love.
9	I'll take the 110 the 60.
9	A little wine with music.
9	The three of spades.
9	Four-twenty.
9	Old time's sake means you got no cash.
9	That plan?
9	He's here.
9	Yes that's a Tintoretto.
9	Call the 980.
9	What would you figure the odds to be Shooter?
9	What'd you do today?
9	Trey to the jacks.
9	I'll try it.
9	That rate 6000 that makes roughly... two hundred dollars an hour.
9	I'm getting frightfully healthy you know.
9	Same to you.
9	Call.
9	It was just like old times.
9	Nine to the kings.
				
9	I've been studying on it.
9	Not anymore.
9	May still be some in that drawer over there.
9	At everything?
9	Now that doesn't go in there.
9	Yes I did.
9	You know who that was Kid?
9	Good evening Mr. Howard.
9	Hey Kid!
9	Bye!
9	You being an Indian and all.
9	Lancey?
9	Where else do you see it?
9	That will be all tonight.
9	No unpleasantness I hope.
9	Come on now Steel Eyes.
9	Well it could happen couldn't it?
9	A gunfight.
9	No other reason?
9	I recollect a young man putting the same question to Eddie the Dude.
9	Ten to the jacks.
9	Least you know how much you mean to somebody.
9	Twenty-five to you Pig.
9	Last card.
9	No straight no flush.
9	Don't you know it.
9	He's a little younger than you isn't he?
9	I got a right to without regard to race creed or color... according to the 14th Amendment.
9	What do you mean buster?
9	Heads.
9	That's right.
9	Nothing doing.
9	Now don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
9	Check those sevens.
9	Well you should.
9	Pair of aces bets.
9	Where you been keeping yourself?
9	Hello everybody.
9	Come on the tougher the competition the better you used to like it.
9	What was the wish?
9	Listen Christian... after the game...
9	Come on.
9	Last card.
9	What do you think we ought to do that's fitting and proper?
9	Bishop's Rock to Ambrose Light without a stop.
9	This is the master bedroom.
9	All right.
9	A deuce to the man.
9	Deal me out.
9	Man I'm outside.
9	They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club... and they've been bonded by the steward.
9	By the authority vested in me this hanging will proceed.
9	Eleven hundred to you Pig.
9	Stud poker.
9	My name isn't Trixie Sir Harry.
9	Quincy-6859 please.
9	Now why do I doubt that?
9	Hey Kid.
9	You gave me two years to pay them.
9	Build your life anew.
9	His uncle Jed was right on the job.
9	Then Cat came along.
9	I'll settle for the 1700 that I've already lost.
9	Pair of sevens.
9	Hi.
9	I might do that.
9	Well then you won't be home for a while.
9	Yeah that's right Lancey.
9	Just a wee bit more Tabasco.
9	How about if she'd go with you and Christian?
9	Just throw our hats in the air.
9	Are you playing tonight or just dealing?
9	Well... we've been playing 30 hours.
9	Oh went to the movies.
9	Well now my cottontail bunny rabbits.
9	I'm sticking.
9	Hundred-and-ninety-four fisheroos to you friend.
9	The longest game I ever played was on the maiden voyage of the Mauretania.
9	It's for my kind of money.
9	Aces up.
9	Eleven hundred.
9	Cowardy custard.
9	About the dance I mean.
9	It does now.
9	Thank you Lancey.
9	Lancey Howard is an old man Shooter.
9	Nine to the sevens.
9	You know the missus.
9	The man himself.
9	Probably both.
9	Well this Spanish general had sent the message that he's coming... to spend the night with his army.
9	Did you see that?
9	But why?
9	Here's the safe.
9	She went home to mama.
9	When are you going?
9	The West has changed.
9	Yeller there tells me how you gutted him once with a pair of fours.
9	Shooter folded a king.
9	Tricks?
9	Remember the Herefords in Yatrona County?
9	Thousand.
9	Like the session we had in St. Louis?
9	Hi Kid.
9	What's so odd about that?
9	You saw that coming did you?
9	It's not gonna be like sitting down with me and Doc Sokal.
9	Mine left me too.
9	You know this game that you're dealing for Lancey and the Kid you know?
9	Then we'll make it 1100.
9	Lancey could be laying for him with three jacks.
9	Son Eddie told him all you paid was the looking price.
9	Yeah that's right Lancey.
9	A bin actually in the pantry.
9	Working.
9	Can you beat that?
9	And it was all in French.
9	I'll be there.
9	You take the 85... and put it back in your bank.
9	I'll play.
9	How much have you got?
9	Not now anyways.
9	Yeah husbands fathers everybody.
9	Thanks Kid.
9	Didn't She Kid?
9	Think so?
9	Couple hundred bucks.
9	How about that mess.
9	Pair of nines bets.
9	Of course you couldn't.
9	Sure it could happen.
9	You did tell the Kid 8:00 didn't you?
9	Welcome back to New Orleans.
9	Hey how's it going?
9	Two thou...?
9	Ace-king bets.
9	Call the sawbuck.
9	Count out the shares.
9	King folds.
9	When I saw you hesitate about accepting that $25000.
9	Another 200.
9	I'll... bet the size of the pot.
9	Ace king 10.
9	Then it's all settled.
9	I know what you mean Mr. Slade.
9	But then again so was Lancey Howard.
9	They're where we want them.
9	Hardly a cellar.
9	Just tie into something nice when you're away from the action... and let it wear itself out.
9	Melba.
9	I got something Shooter.
9	Keep dealing.
9	Three sevens.
9	I don't think you have it in you Miss Ballou.
9	Where are those kids?
9	Mama this is Eric.
9	That's true.
9	Well...
9	Better write yourself a new book daddy.
9	Call.
9	What about you Jackson?
9	Well I hope it isn't gonna be one of those marathon games.
9	Five... 10 14.
9	Compulsory call Kid.
9	It may be just a rumor.
9	That's how it usually comes out in the long run.
9	Yeah.
9	Doc...
9	Shelleen!
9	Is that right Shooter?
9	It's a whole new deal.
9	Piggy Pig Pig.
9	It'll be history.
9	Oh a three.
9	Our lucky friend from Baton Rouge gets a big fat queen with his pair of sixes.
9	That was a challenge and a matter of pride... to see that it was robbed. And so on and so on.
9	You see I've been where I'm going.
9	You let him fake you out.
9	I'm looking for the baggage car.
9	Well that's fine.
9	You'll never guess where we've just been.
9	Pair of queens.
9	I know.
9	Hey you know there was a guy in the game that accused me of juicing the deck?
9	Everything went slicker than...
9	You'll need more than just two of us.
9	Here you are Tricky.
9	He never has been.
9	Guns bottles fists knives clubs... all the same to me.
9	One-seventy-five.
9	Just deal Lady Fingers.
9	You cold?
9	You mind shutting those drapes?
9	Call it.
9	Hi.
9	Melba?
9	He'll take out Pig first.
9	Do you approve?
9	Christian help your mother with the dishes.
9	You don't ever change do you?
9	Queen four 10 king king... and an ace to the man.
9	You gonna bust everybody or am I?
9	Thanks Lancey.
9	Cost you a grand.
9	We don't bother them nor Sir Harry Percival and they don't bother us.
9	He don't chase the Kid nowhere.
9	Three of hearts.
9	My pleasure.
9	Nineteenth century science...
9	Before I raised?
9	I understand that stud poker is your game.
9	I think we'll go to St. Louis.
9	To lose.
9	Well I'd say the New York money will probably lay about... oh 8-5 on Lancey.
9	Sit down.
9	These rooms have been contracted for the ante will be $10 per chair per day.
9	Well?
9	Hello.
9	No I'm going.
9	Sir a consolation from the town.
9	Of course towns do change though don't they?
9	Fold.
9	Thanks Kid.
9	You sure?
9	Jacks bet.
9	Where's the Shooter?
9	That right Melba?
9	Thank you for the privilege sir.
9	Maybe two or three hands at the right time.
9	Pair of jacks.
9	But you've got to remember that he's the man see?
9	That plan!
9	Yeah you told me Shooter.
9	It doesn't matter.
9	How's that?
9	Hello in there!
9	The Kid could break lucky and stay ahead the whole game couldn't he?
9	How are yours Kid?
9	Later.
9	A regular Tintoretto.
9	Why not?
9	Seventeen to you Philly.
9	You don't get around these parts much anymore.
9	What do you want Cat?
9	Well are you coming back?
9	Sign this.
9	Everybody else did it.
9	Yeah.
9	Let's go to St. Louis.
9	So when I walk in I gab with him.
9	Likewise.
9	You'll just have to use it.
9	Sir Harry Percival.
9	Once upon a time... down in Shreveport Louisiana... there was this bad little girl named Melba Nyle.
9	What's the action?
9	What do you mean call?
9	What's in the pot?
9	I don't know how good they are.
9	It's nothing.
9	Call.
9	Hundred.
9	Well are you aware of the circumstances on which she left Shreveport Louisiana?
9	Yes I'm aware.
9	You just think that over.
9	Bet the pot 2700.
9	New York Chicago Miami.
9	Honey why don't you go out to the kitchen and bring us some of those... fancy little hors d'oeuvres.
9	You can't blame them can you?
9	Pair of sevens says...
9	If you can call you can beat.
9	Thank you.
9	Also.
9	Give the old man a drink.
9	Yes I'll do that.
9	Let's go to St. Louis.
9	You remember Spider Man don't you?
9	I had them both beat with a pair of fives.
9	Mrs. Hoban.
9	Since that game in Corpus.
9	Now Kid what's your game?
9	Just fine.
9	Get a case of cartridges from Cassidy.
9	You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action... day in and day out.
9	Deal them up Shooter.
9	Gentlemen this game is five-card stud poker.
9	Get along with it.
9	Hoban tell you about Yeller?
9	Champagne Hansen!
9	Thirty-seven if memory serves.
9	Why that's exactly what I was about to do sugar.
9	Betting interest that is.
9	What you got on me Kid?
9	Look at that!
9	Queens check to the possibles.
9	How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter?
9	There you go all serious all of a sudden.
9	That's why they chose you to give them a fair deal.
9	How the town treating you?
9	He shouldn't have eh?
9	That's another question.
9	Hello there.
9	Dallas or Tulsa?
9	Alice Lee honey would you like to freshen up Mr. William's drink a little bit?
9	I'll call your 1500 and raise you... 2500.
9	Why don't you just go?
9	Well I mean... when you admire a man you just go all out.
9	Jack high.
9	Losing that posse.
9	It's just the beginning.
9	A little more bourbon Mr. William?
9	Across the river.
9	I won't tell it anymore.
9	Don't lose no sweat Kid.
9	That's when they start to drift away.
9	You can check and raise.
9	Thanks for the entertainment gentlemen.
9	No not today.
9	Will you lend me a bullet?
9	You know that was a sweet thing you did to the Pig with those jacks.
9	You and Strawn use to play when you were children?
9	Well your stakes are my pleasure sir.
9	What a time for you to fall off the wagon.
9	Oh hi sugar.
9	What do you keep betting out for?
9	What's happening?
9	Me Pig Yeller and Doc Sokal.
9	They're red bloodshot.
9	Well now where are you going?
9	No look Slade...
9	Possible straight.
9	And Shooter Lady Fingers and me just carried them right here.
9	No you're not.
9	Help me clear this table.
9	You will?
9	Fog your mind so you can't remember a darn thing.
9	Pair of nines.
9	I'll see you later Shooter.
9	Shooter's wife wanted to go.
9	Well it's time.
9	Take it Lancey.
9	You know I've got something.
9	Thirty-seven.
9	Yes I'm playing tonight.

9	Do any good?
9	Comes from one of the richest families in the state.
9	Pair of jacks bets.
9	Eight o'clock Monday apartment 2A at the old Lafayette.
9	Good evening gentlemen.
9	Came here to play.
9	You did.
9	Yeah I saw it coming.
9	We can use Shelleen's own plan for train robbery.
9	My pleasure Lady Fingers.
9	Just the way I figured it'd be.
9	Trey.
9	Well?
9	You want a job?
9	Fold.
9	That's the biggest pot yet.
9	Nearer 40 or 50000 I'd say.
9	Unless you wanted me to stay.
9	Yeah and the husbands are happy.
9	Ten's bet.
9	Well why don't we make it about... lunchtime.
9	Well that's pretty sweet.
9	Ten.
9	You gonna play the Kid?
9	Long enough to think of her almost fondly.
9	I'll see you later.
9	Well that makes me about even gentlemen.
9	You know how it is.
9	What was the movie about?
9	Eights.
9	The Cincinnati Kid.
9	I don't need marked cards to beat you pal.
9	Any card you want.
9	Pull those drapes!
9	Local celebrity I understand.
9	I'm in.
9	Pair of sevens says 1500 bucks.
9	That butcher Eggers he'll take 35 head... and butcher them himself.
9	Well I guess you might say that yes.
9	Well... just the two of us Kid.
9	Take me around the block a couple of times.
9	Ask him how we'll get outta here.
9	Well the Kid hit him once and he ain't come back yet.
9	Regardless.
9	Hi.
9	What other reason could there be?
9	And if I refuse to sign it?
9	How do you do Mrs. Rudd?
9	I can't.
9	Or didn't you know Christian?
9	Playing with amateurs huh?
9	Look Shooter...
9	I want everything he's got.
9	I don't believe that beats three fours do it?
9	You don't want me... around your neck.
9	Six days.
9	Ain't my game Eddie.
9	No such thing.
9	Jack to the king.
9	There's a bus that leaves tonight.
9	Aces up.
9	Two and a half.
9	Well I do declare Christian.
9	It's out of the question Mr. Slade.
9	I call.
9	What happened?
9	Who's in charge?
9	Well I'm glad we had this little chat.
9	Right there... in those big blue eyes.
9	If you didn't try new things there'd be no progress.
9	He's got an awful lot to protect.
9	All right then.
9	All right.
9	Hello Shooter.
9	Hi honey.
9	You got old.
9	New deck please.
9	Stay here.
9	Rob a train.
9	Deuce.
9	Hold these for me till I get some money.
9	That right mister?
9	Green pastures await the tired sinner and honey flows like water.
9	There's plenty of money on you too.
9	I'm against it.
9	Not money and not a job...
9	There's an awful lot of interest developing in that game.
9	Who's afraid of a little booger?
9	They've been running right by me all day Kid.
9	You got something to say about our plan?
9	Some money?
9	Yeah let's go a little while.
9	Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
9	What have you got?
9	Possible flush.
9	You know that valise of mine?
9	I've been building a reputation for 25 years.
9	I'm all packed.
9	Howdy.
9	Seven to the queen.
9	Oh just things that little girls dream about.
9	I fold.
9	Hold.
9	All that dust at the pit.
9	The creatures were about uh four foot.

9	That is uh...
9	Yellow!
9	Financing this is Dale!
9	Oh not really.
9	Where are you?
9	Kirk was producing a motion picture his first.
9	You can put that away.
9	I don't believe I do.
9	What's the occasion?
9	Nothing sir. I'm just searching the corporal.
9	This is our skipper Lt. Mason.
9	All other movements are restricted.
9	President Underwood?
9	How are we gonna do that?
9	Dig me out a flying suit.
9	So now then. This Vago in the story you told about Lompoc.
9	How are you doing?
9	I don't have any combat training I don't think...
9	The pressure is described by this isobaric curve which is forcing this low trough off to the east.
9	That's where I got it.
9	Who?
9	What?
9	Let's go.
9	It is about 900000 euros.
9	Got an address?
9	Jill?

9	Hey Tom.
9	Yes your company.

9	Okay.
9	Like me in my shoes and on display for men and women to examine for different reasons.
9	Josh.

9	Is this the Assistant DA ReiIIy?
9	Welcome to Nassau.
9	I know.
9	All right. Here we go.
9	It's rosewood.
9	Yes.
9	The last Contessa.
9	It must be in your genes.
9	There's no corroborative evidence.
9	Yanisko worried about?
9	And another.
9	What they've done is they formed this alliance among themselves of the industry that makes money by building war machines.
9	Of course.
9	What?
9	Bring the arrow back here.
9	We are directly under.
9	I just got married.
9	There is an American on board.
9	Mr. Inglethorp.
9	No not Hastings.
9	A high-priority item... Was the analysis of fingerprints found in Ms. Polhemus' apartment.
9	Me and my brother...
9	I'm spending more time with her now. And you know why?
9	There might be some insurance.
9	I gave this document to the head of intelligence for the joint chiefs of staff
9	There was a cousin called Caroline.
9	Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
9	Not exactly funny it's just that you're so different from your son.
9	Willie note the time.
9	Look.
9	You're the boss.
9	There is no time to waste.
9	Yes I know him.
9	All in.
9	Barney.
9	As for the rest of what I have to say you will find it neatly typed at some length on this piece of paper.
9	They decided to stay upstairs.
9	And who are they?
9	You work for me.
9	Posting a letter.
9	But you haven't talked to him ever since?
9	Who is it?
9	Where did he go?
9	This is my new roommate Aretha.
9	I don't even look like a biker.
9	They got to you didn't they?
9	No sir.
9	Harvey what is that?
9	Juliette was there.
9	Apparently it was a true combat.
9	To work.
9	It is already going to call the doctor.
9	Cash works for me.
9	Do we bring the bags?
9	This is Kevin Quinn Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney County of New York.
9	Bank footage on Alder.
9	This is a restricted area.
9	Did I hear Lieutenant Junior Grade?
9	Guess what his name is the captain?
9	I think that this is a cocoa we will send them to me for analysis.
9	Why go to his palace?
9	What do you think?
9	Left to 180.
9	Kirk if ever a characterization followed a straight line yours does.
9	Miss!
9	I'll go take a look around.
9	I know Skinny Marie.
9	I don't.
9	I looked at him I looked down at the picture and I said
9	What's the idea?
9	How many deals do you think get cut in the men's room?
9	Me and Powell we make him as king of the biggest chop-shop operation in the Southland.
9	That's the whole theory of Independence Day.
9	Hold everything.
9	But if I had to write down what no actress should ever make public I would copy Maria's testimony in her father's defense.
9	Why?
9	Off with the boy scouts?
9	All right somebody's gonna have to pinch-hit for Andy.
9	Because he was able to find out about your tab.
9	I understand that.
9	Tell us in your own words tell us what happened.
9	Leave the cars here.
9	And so I concluded what we should be doing about it is not militarizing the relationship but sort of having a citizens diplomacy effort much like the physicians for social responsibility who were going to the Soviet Union to create a dialog during the coldest days of the Cold War.
9	You do not deny then that such a monster could exist. Is that correct?
9	Hsiao-tsing!
9	Yes.
9	You can still back out of all this.
9	And the star decides whether to make the meeting or abort.
9	They weren't in the ship.
9	She said I stabbed that son of a bitch plenty of times.
9	Oh home team.
9	I think I was a little in love with her.

9	Remember?
9	Everything's fine.
9	No.

9	Do come in.
9	You're a highly-respected journalist.
9	Mr. Vincent Antonelli will throw out the first ball.
9	The will disappears and she takes his secret to the gravestone.
9	I work there.
9	This is not a contested document.
9	Where is it made?
9	I though it was brother. Brother....
9	He went after him like...
9	River Rouge. The old sludge plant.
9	The girl caught the next train.
9	Oh yeah?
9	The fact that you and I are still breathing the free air of Earth is abundant testimony to their restraint and non hostility.
9	Long arduous combat duty.
9	Where's Jerry?
9	Elder!
9	It's tied up at my dock.
9	Ned listen to me.
9	To steal it?

9	No more questions.
9	It's me Brian.
9	Come on Wilbur.
9	Fatter? - No Dad.
9	If so we would like to be heard on that question.
9	Majesty my opinion is ... - ...
9	I saw you talking.
9	A man's got to do what he's got to do.
9	'Yes Your Majesty.
9	I know a lot of nice girls.
9	We'll answer anything you want to know.
9	Some of them are happy because they are beautiful and some of them have to be happy because they're nothing but rich.
9	Suppose I could prove it to you. Suppose I asked you for your help. Would you give it to me without telling anybody not saying anything to anyone?
9	What did you call me? Captain?
9	Isabelle!

9	My grandfather believes the men who create a company should control its destiny.
9	Dirk?
9	And I thought

9	What in your complaint goes the further step of saying actually they're participating in the venture to sex traffic as opposed to advertise?
9	We're taking Detroit private.
9	It's getting late.
9	When I find Phyllis...
9	I obeyed Mr Maryk.
9	That's my job.
9	It goes away.

9	She haunts my dreams... just kidding.
9	Well she did sort of embrace it once she did.
9	Who do you think it is?

9	May I get you something to drink sir?
9	Which one do we use?
9	There's no answer from the room.
9	Lights out at 10:00 Henry.
9	I was briefed into a special access program involving the US government's investigation and contacts with extraterrestrial.
9	And it isn't oil or gas either.

9	Yes.
9	He's still here.
9	Why?
9	Distance: 5000.
9	That evidence is being examined.
9	What's that mean?
9	No one there...
9	There's no urgent message.
9	You're a size six right?
9	Hold the fishbowl.
9	I won't be out too late.
9	What's it say?
9	Who are you?
9	Al this is Preston Pearlstein.
9	Oh.
9	Wait.
9	And you will get your opportunity to address us.
9	Well you have a week.
9	Open it.
9	Before I realized what you are.
9	I've seen it.
9	I've been gone a long time.

9	David are you okay?
9	Mr. Harriman.
9	Go on Tom.
9	Mujahideen.
9	Me and Judy Rose walked over as I said.
9	I read the official announcement in the ship's newspaper on my way over about six months ago that Maria Damata was going to marry Count Torlato-Favrini.
9	He's told you all he knows.
9	Before we can fight the force holding her I must give it a name.
9	...forwarded to the fbi Washington.
9	Stand in the door.
9	Nobody did.
9	Half-brothers.
9	Repeat.
9	Next.
9	Helmsman left 180.
9	There are important people on it.
9	I'm standing in front of an East L.A. garage which is the latest link in a chain of six chop shops busted by the L.A.P.D in the last three days. This is Auto Theft Detective Nick Pulovski.
9	Now I'd like to explain just what this will mean.
9	Do we have the airline tickets?
9	Tell him I'm detoxing.
9	I'll need another one of these filled up from in there.
9	Ensign Jere Torrey.
9	Do you have a car?
9	Forceps! -Forceps.
9	A Trevie and others.
9	Standby.

9	S-K-I ending.
9	Ben?
9	Hungry?
9	Lydia: Duck! - I knew you were gonna get that?
9	Are we all joined ones yes? With an exception.
9	A submarine boat.
9	To go back to Moscow.
9	And this is something that is at the biggest change economically in the history of the human race.
9	The law simply says as a website operator I am not responsible as the publisher of what people are putting up on my website.
9	OK.
9	Remember these?
9	What can we eat dad? - Hmm?
9	I am the whore the King.
9	So do you. That's why you had her come down here.
9	Hunky-dory.
9	Everybody been sworn?
9	The people want paradise.
9	First the simplest of all the Beretta 93R 9mm automatic 20 shots maximum.
9	Then perhaps you read many cheap novels. I understand.
9	He wants to be as hot as the young Ensign Queeg.
9	Anything else?
9	Let me get another.
9	Oh Danny boy.
9	Slip inside.
9	What about rats?
9	I command you close your blouse! Watch this bud.
9	I did.
9	Come on.
9	Yes sir. - Do you know this young lady?
9	Ballistics will confirm it was the same gun used in the Julio Sierra killing.
9	Wait! Hey come back!
9	Hello?
9	You want to go?
9	No we need to get you to a hospital.
9	Are you sure?
9	Where is Miss Windy?
9	Professor?
9	What?
9	This is so.
9	What do I think?
9	What's the matter?
9	I want a drink!
9	I guess.
9	Or ever?
9	Gentlemen there's a story for your papers.
9	If I had to do it again I'd do it.
9	You and Leslie me and Tara. The actual ta-ra.
9	Yeah.
9	Come on Tommy.
9	So maybe there are others.
9	What witness?
9	It is not necessary to ask the reason of his presence here Inspector Japp.
9	Leader this is Three.
9	Start a whole new operation.
9	Aye sir.
9	Who's ready to clean me up?
9	You call the Fingerprint Lab on the bar glass?
9	Ringo!
9	I'm just gonna borrow your phone. -Right this way please.
9	They're rescuing their kids taking to the streets.
9	As long as you don't swallow it.
9	Sorry sir. Just a little turbulence in the thermals on the windward side of the mountain.
9	Clive Ned I'll tell you something.
9	Why?
9	Sort of takin' the long way aren't ya?
9	Do you think the keys are in his pocket?
9	As we prepare for departure we ask that you pay close attention...
9	What's the nature of your visit?
9	Attention to colours.
9	Invitation only unless of course you invite yourself.
9	You made money with Bobby huh?
9	Like the moon.
9	Mom and Dad's.
9	If Mr. Stern is truly going to endeavor to prove... That the case against Mr. Sabich has been manufactured... Then this history of antagonism is relevant for those purposes.
9	What's his name again?
9	Your predecessor at that desk
9	The strategy that Wernher Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians were the enemy against whom we were going to build space-based weapons.
9	Your report will cover all of it.
9	I lament to know it my lady.
9	Survival of the fittest I guess.
9	You Caulfield? - Yeah.
9	What are you doing here?
9	Look at all the stuff I brought for our trip.
9	What did you do?
9	I'll see you tonight.
9	One could argue... If the jury feels I'm being truthful about something so painful... They should believe me when I say I didn't commit the murder.
9	Did you hear that professor?
9	No stay in those eggs!
9	Mr Maryk tell me how much sand is left.
9	What are we gonna do?
9	You don't mind coming along.
9	Get the legs.
9	Yekaterina Orlova.
9	Now at approximately 12:30 this morning something happened.
9	You want you and Tommy to be tight.
9	You think you're clever. You're not fooling me!
9	I do not know.
9	We're gonna walk.
9	He went 'bang'!
9	Oh by the way he wants to know if his neighbor next door starts earning his keep tomorrow.
9	Here let's take this robe off.
9	Mike.
9	I can't believe it.
9	I do not know who plays the violin. Paganini.
9	Red boy! There you are!
9	Let's go back and get them.
9	It lets it call me to investigate this subject.
9	How do you like it?
9	Tell them you're closed.
9	But he kept it to himself. He kept a lot to himself.
9	Unless you can show me I'm wrong that you share my values and concerns.
9	By the end of 2012 public pressure on Backpage seems to evaporate
9	That is until Sheriff Tom Dart in Chicago frustrated with the number of sex-trafficked victims he's finding decides to take matters into his own hands.
9	Suppose we try to get you on the bench.
9	We may need it.
9	Charlie.
9	Hey guys.
9	All right talk!
9	None whatsoever.
9	What's what like?
9	He's my lawyer.
9	Resume our base course.
9	He'd worked hard for many years in the American corporate structure.
9	Yeah a little bit.
9	How you doing?
9	How will I know you?
9	Like this?
9	FBI was on high alert. They investigated every threat.
9	Me and my chauffeur here was driving on Park Avenue around midnight.
9	Joyce?
9	Don't you see that it's happening all around you?
9	Placed in a deep freeze and sent to Wright Patt field in Dayton Ohio.
9	Undercover!
9	You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through?
9	Oh of course we are.
9	What do you think?
9	Allow yourself to be taken over by the faint fragility which will make your face beautiful.
9	That is the point.
9	Let me tell you who we were.
9	It's not important.
9	What is this?
9	Behind the bar come on! Not you.
9	Oh you taught me something today.
9	And now you're no longer necessary.
9	But what it does in England Poirot?
9	We? - My father.
9	lmprovise.
9	They value their writers.
9	We can try.
9	And in business you need...
9	I tell you what I believe.
9	Make sure you're there.
9	They're not telling the whole story.
9	You should have seen her mother.
9	Something wrong?
9	Her family's big socially and doesn't want any publicity. We're takin' her home.
9	Once he discovers who it was... He'll put the case into the file of the unsolved murders.
9	How could that happen?
9	Hello?

9	We need more knots to outrun it.
9	The press will hound you with that man's legend for as long as you wear gloves.
9	No questions asked.
9	The temperature in that day it was of 27 degrees to the shadow.
9	What category of mission is she for?
9	Alfred...
9	Yes please do.
9	But I would ask you to rethink this.

9	Am I supposed to offer to publish it?
9	Midian.
9	I'll call Ducky.
9	I gotta bring up the Pretty Wom thing.
9	Calculate the three and then ...
9	I'm gonna do one for you.
9	You see but the bad news is Kid has agreed to sponsor you as a Prospect.

9	Is there a problem sir?
9	Everybody out the back door!

9	It would then be private.
9	We've got the perfect weapon right over our heads.
9	How-to books?
9	What the hels going on?
9	Right.
9	Oh my gosh she was bubbly and outgoing.
9	And this is exactly what happened when I met with Lord Hill-Norton.
9	I'm representing her.
9	Well stop it!
9	And the kids are just fine. But now they're taking acting lessons.
9	Am I reading this right?
9	Can you give me a little more time?
9	What's the matter?
9	Could be nothing could be something.
9	I checked through our logs. Two days after Tarlow got ice we got a call.
9	That was nearly a six.
9	Come on.
9	We used to call ourselves the Sinners then.
9	And three no Chappie.
9	This time I want you to go.
9	But if you want the best go with the best.

9	And you never reported him.
9	And you had contact in the hallway?
9	Perfect.
9	My uncle is dead I swear.
9	You'll land dig in and wait.
9	Walk from there we are going to return for house.
9	Commander Powell.
9	I want to see some results.
9	Maybe if I shrug and move my hands like this people will think I know what I'm talking about.
9	Tonight and all these years.
9	Yeah.
9	Well I guess it's back to Mr. martelli.
9	Hello.
9	Do you read me?
9	You need Brockhart by your side supporting you.
9	They were stealing money from their clients.

9	Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill that would loosen his tongue and then...
9	I'll give them a lesson.
9	I've never been a great chair-price guesser.
