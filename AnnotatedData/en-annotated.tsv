And if you don't take me to my hotel , that means I have to walk .	1, 6
And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there .	1, 3

And where I come from , you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking .	1, 2
And whoever holds [LOCATION] points a dagger at the heart of [LOCATION] .	1
And you agree ?	1, 3
And you also have to cross-modify your judgment that the entire universe was created just as the stage upon which the drama of the human development is unfolding .	1
And you can't make me .	1
And you think I don't ?	1, 3
And you wan na know what else I think ?	1
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life .	1
And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances , the way he kept admitting over and over that he killed the old lady .	1, 3
And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. [PERSON] , would you ?	1, 2, 4

But I just escaped from here ! Don't you understand ?	1
But I need to know where it is .	1
But I won't stand it any longer .	1
But I'm always going to be a killer .	1
But if the last powder was taken there is two days it can not be very important .	1
But if you care about us , you do not do this .	8, 1, 6
But if you do not work hard you will be punished .	1
But if you're asking me what I want to do , I'm telling you that I haven't decided .	1
But it soon became obvious that the senor was only mildly interested in the available talent .	1, 6
But it's not real .	1, 3

But [PERSON] never speaks with me , it will be possible to avoid it .	8, 1, 6
But my shirt is wet .	1

But what I tell [PERSON] to do , she will do .	8, 1
But you can not do this !	1
But you do remember this , don't you ?	1
But you don't hear me complaining .	1
But you make one slip , just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage .	1, 2
But you shouldn't open other people's letters .  	1
But you still haven't answered me .	1
But you're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .	1
But you're holding something back .	1, 2
But , [PERSON] , whatever it is that you're going through , we can help you , but you need to ... How the hell would you know what I need ?	1

And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	3
And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	3

And nice earrings for a streetwalker .	3, 7
And no promises on the sentence .	3, 6

And shave off that dreadful moustache .	3
And sometimes I think some junkie nurse may be stepping on my medication .	3

Acknowledging defeat is never easy .	6
Afraid not . dollars , please .	6
After all she done ?	6, 7
After all , I had caused the girl considerable discomfort .	6
After that , things kind of went downhill .	6, 7
Ah , yes ! ' I had a migraine , your Majesty .	8, 6, 7
Ah , you should have stuffed her in the car with the friend .	6, 7
All I ever do is try to make you happy .	6

All I heard was trash talk .	6
All I wan na do is clean it up , get it right .	6
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	8, 2, 6
All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts .	6
All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	6
All my powers have gone .	6
All that bread and livin' in a dump like this . Smashed cars , busted - out buses ... but all good stashes .	6

Am I so strange to you ?	6
An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to [LOCATION] .	6
An animal had gnawed off its own foot to escape from a trap .	6
And denied .	6
And for that , I can never forgive myself .	6
And he was so sorry for locking me up .	6
And he will be missed .	6
And I cried the whole time .	6
And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus .	6
And I don't want to ....	6
And I'm thinking that , well ... maybe the mill's taking you away from me and [PERSON] .	6
And I'm tweaking . I'm outta money .	6
And I've loved something that doesn't really exist .	6
And in a fit of anger , I told her that our being together , our rekindled romance , was a big mistake .	6
And isaac started flying up To the sad broken star .	6
And just what exactly are your intentions , young man ?	6, 7
And no one will believe me .	6
And she got in a car accident .	6
And so I turned away my head and wept .	6
And Spider Man died kind of slow .	6
And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment , which we do not and which we will prove .	6, 7
And that's all I can give you .	6
And then came the war .	6
And then I - I don't know what happened .	6
And then this morning - I lost 'em . - We lost them .	6, 7
And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown .	6
And then , of course , there was the unexpected and , I must say , regrettable suicide of [PERSON] .	6
And they're having more fun .	6
And to my surprise to my deep surprise , it's harder to say goodbye than I thought .	6
And we didn't know how to help her deal with it .	6
And what most people don't see ... is just how hard it is to do the right thing .	6
And you've been resenting me .	6
Another funeral for the pilot , not as spiffy as [PERSON]'s .	6
Any more than I could on that night I saw [PERSON] for the last time .	6
Anyway the orders promoting him to Detective , First Grade , have already been cut .	6
Anyway you can't go to the hospital .	6, 7
Anyways , no good no more , Kid .	6
Are you all alone in there ?	6
Are you crying ?	6
Arguing's pretty much in my blood .	6
As for me , I'm just a slave .	6
As it is , this is not the life I want for our children , for myself and for you .	6
As long as there was [PERSON] , there was a chance we might be happy .	6
As long as you're here , let me show you the books ... so you can see how bad a businessman I am .	6
At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	6
[PERSON] was worried too . 	6
Aw . What happened ?	6, 7
Bad for you , worse for me .	6
Barney , I am sorry .	6
Because I am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone .	6
Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ?	6
Because it was my misery .	6
Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime .	8, 6
Because when you talked about murder on the tapes ... I assumed it was just hallucination .	6
Been dead over hours .	6
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ...	6
Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	2, 6
Behind this eloquent exterior , I've got a yellow streak miles wide .	6
Being real is a joke in your world ?	6
[LOCATION] laughed at my theory .	6

Breaking my heart with your impossible love !	6
But don't look so gloomy .	6
But even so , it is quite awful when nobody in loves , is not ?	6
But he's an angry guy . Picks up something , kills her .	6
But he's dead .	6
But I am guilty .	6
But I can't play them with you .	6
But I don't care about any of that now .	6
But I paid a heavy price .	6
But I shouldn't have left like that . I'm sorry .	8, 6
But I thought we were gonna be partners .	6
But I want to be alone .	6
But I was crying because I. ...	6
But I will not attempt one here and now .	6, 7
But I'm gonna miss you , baby .	6
But I'm missin' it , man .	6
But in that case , We are no more guilty than the rest of the world .	6
But it was that that looked .	6, 7
But it's sad .	6
But [LOCATION]'s a horrid place .	6
But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you .	6
But now , I don't suppose I shall ever see it again .	6
But problems don't just go , [PERSON] , you know ?	6
But really , was there any choice ?	6
But [PERSON] is gone .	6
But that is not true .	6
But that's another story , and a very unpleasant one , too .	6
But the man I'm in love with doesn't .	6
But the war had changed him .	6
But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time .	6
But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00 .	6
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	6, 7
But when I told the police , I do not think they believed me .	6
But when the sick one is yourself , you can not run away .	6
But when you worry , darkness does something to you .	6
But you can't .	6
But you can not help her .	6
But you had to wait till now , now when [PERSON]'s dying ... to show me that I could never mean any more to you ... than this Watling woman does to [PERSON] .	6
But you have to make a change to your life , put in some effort .	6, 7
But you look like you're more upset than that .	6
But you seem to go to [LOCATION] rather more than you come to [LOCATION] .	6, 7
But you were never there for me , Dad .	6
But you would have gone ...	6
But you'll never find another [PERSON] .	6
But you're not enjoying yourself .	6
But , you see , it's really his wife that's keeping them apart .	6
But . .	6, 7
But ...	2, 6
By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly .	6
By the way , [PERSON] , about your car ...	6
Bye .	6
Can not afford a dowry to each of his daughters .	6
Can we ever believe again ?	6
Can you , can you , can you , meet me , please .	2, 6
Can -- I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you ?	6

Come on , man .	6, 7
Completely out of our hands . - I don't accept that . - It's out of your hands .	6
Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in [LOCATION] .	6
Cos I think that people die sometimes when they don't wan na live no more .	6
Could we just go over one or two more ...	6
Daddy , I want Mommy !	6
Daddy , there are balloons floating away .	6
Daisy's leaving you .	6
Dear Mr. [PERSON] .   This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes .  	6, 7
[PERSON] , your mother and I have brought you to this spot to share this last private ... This moment of ... Grief and pain .	6
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	8, 6
Death was from suffocation .	6
[PERSON] will never stand for it .	6
Did I say something wrong ?	6
Did you have a warrant ?	6
Disappointing .	6, 7
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to could be so weak .	6
Do not .	6, 7
Do you have a boyfriend ?	2, 6, 7
Do you know how many people are dying ?	6, 7
Do you think nobody can tell ?	6
Do you want to know everything ?	6
Doc , I don't want to fly any more .	6
Doctor , can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts ?	6
Does this mean you don't like me anymore ?	6
[PERSON] tried to straighten her out .	6
Don't bother about me .	6
Don't cry , honey .	6
Don't cry .	6
Don't drink alone .	6
Don't forget me , [PERSON] .	8, 6

Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now .	6
Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6
Don't look so depressed .	6
Don't make me feel like this .	6
Don't you think she's paid her dues ?	8, 6
Don't you want me with you ?	6
During the night , I was woken by [PERSON] crying .	6
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	6
[PERSON] was killed .	6
[PERSON] , how long has it been since I said I love you ?	6
[PERSON] drowned the day before his fourth birthday .	6
Especially when there are no days and nights in it , but just days that turn black when the sun goes down .	6
Even though we have each other . It can be a very lonely existence .	6
Even when we rehearsed it , I felt something sad and tender .	6
Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	6
Every time I think about it , I get sad and depressed , and I'm having flashbacks .	6
Everybody except me .	6
Everybody's mother's got to die sometime .	6
Everybody's waiting .	2, 6
Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship .	6
Everyone sees this thing except me .	6
Everyone was in mourning .	6
Everything is cold and finished .	6
Everything is part of the great lie .	6
Faced with that ... regardless of my personal feelings for the boy , my sense of duty told me that his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer .	6
Fail !	6, 7
Fantasia will be forgotten .	6
Fate and too many painkillers .	6
Father [PERSON] told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself .	6, 7
Father , I'm at the end of my rope .	6
Feel better ?	6
[PERSON] , I have the most terrible news for you .	6
Fifty of them froze to death in one night .	6
Fine , fine . Say , [PERSON] , something kind of important has come up ...	6
First [PERSON] , now [PERSON] .	6
Five Wounds , for short .	6
[LOCATION] is not gonna have a baby .	6
For an hour . An hour ?	2, 6, 7
For me , the fun went out of it after [PERSON] died . It was never any good , really , after that .	6
For these and all my sins of my past life , I am heartily sorry .	6
For us , business is lousy .	6
Forget me .	6
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned .	6
Forgive me .	6
Forgive me ...	6
From then on I was hopelessly lost .	6
From top to bottom we are riddled with cruelty .	6
Fuckin' wearin' me out .	6
Gentlemen , it is difficult to admit to an error .	6
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	6
[PERSON] , there's no point in going on .	6
Get rid of your gum .	6, 7
[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6
God , forgive me .	6
Gone .	6

Good - bye , [PERSON] .	6

He let go of my hand . And I was lost .	4, 6
He leveraged himself up to his eyeballs . The investments didn't work out ... He got himself in serious debt .	3, 6
He looks terrible .	6
He lost all his patients , he didn't wan na go to the office .	6
He must be going out of his mind .	6

He said he forgot .	6, 7

He shot himself .	3, 4, 6
He should be here with his family .	6
He shouldn't be a cop .	6, 7
He shouldn't have to decide here .	6
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope ... and gives the slow death of slavery .	6
He talks about the great lie  . 	6
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times , and how , on the night of the murder , she not only smashed his radio but hit him .	1, 3, 4, 6
He thinks it's a wonderful evening and then she takes a handful of pills and overdoses .	1, 6
He told me they're getting cold feet .	1, 3, 6
He tried to remember that power he used to have over women back in his dangerous days .	6
He used to use his hands .	6
He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	6, 7
He was gonna die ?	4, 6, 7
He was my brother .	6
He was [PERSON]'s beau , and he loved her , not me .	6
He wasn't much good , though .	6
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	3, 6
He wouldn't have , unless he were discouraged and angry .	6
He'd undergone a lot of strain .	6
He'll never get started .	6
He's a little bit grumpy right now .	6
He's a poor boy .	6
He's a real choirboy .	6

Honey , I haven't had a chance to really talk to her ...	6
How awful .	6
How can I make you believe me ?	2, 6
How can I take time when I know what's going on ?	6
How can I ?	6
How can we be sure she'll help us free the Childlike Empress ?	6
How can you be so cruel and unfeeling ?	6
How can you be so mean ?	3, 6
How can you forget yourselves this way ?	6
How can you think that I could do a thing like that ?	3, 6, 7
How could he say a thing like that ?	1, 3, 6, 7
How could I have forgotten about [PERSON] ?	6
How could you speak of love to me , say the things you did , and you about to be married .	6
How dare you , you ... How long has she been in this condition ?	1, 3, 4, 6, 7
How did we end up talking about your death from my drug test ? I don't understand .	6
How did you find me ?	6, 7

How do you mean that ? And now you will laugh .	6, 7

$ , for a taxi !	7
A beautiful woman like you ?	7
A bus ?	7
A cook ?	7
A few years ago , you was a truck driver .	7
A good thing my reactions are so fast	7
A good - looking girl like you ?	7
A heroic thought , Barley .	7
A horse - ranch Indian , a drunken gunfighter , a sex maniac ... and an uncle !	7
A hundred thousand dollars ?	7
A quarter of a million dollars ?	7
A rather odd reaction .	7
A Webley automatic ...	7
About what happened . When ?	2, 7
Abracadabra !	7
Acid ?	7
[PERSON] ? - Yeah !	2, 7
Actually , we don't know a soul here .	7

Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	7
Ah , the ring !	7
Ah , was from there .	7
Ah . You believed in it and you fought for it .	7
Ah ... I see it pays to advertise on television .	7
Ain't she seen a man before ?	7
Ain't that the girl [PERSON] went lookin' for ?	7
[PERSON] , you got here fast .	7
[PERSON] , don't you remember ?	7
[PERSON] , you remind me of someone I used to know .	7
[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	7
All ?	7
All of a sudden , there's a lot of noise .	7
All of them ?	7
All of you !	7
All that gossip !	7
All that money , [PERSON] ?	7
Allow me to get that bag for you .	2, 7
Am I interrupting something ?	7
An engineer ?	7
An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	7
And did you believe this nonsense ?	7
And everybody say hello to kit - [PERSON] !	7
And he who spies and flies away lives to spy another day .	7
And he wouldn't let you help him ?	7
And I got so drunk I puked spaghetti everywhere .	7
And I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule .	7
And I was thinking more of sushi ?	7
And I was with some boys in the neighborhood , and we saw this and went ,  Oh , My God ! 	7
And if I kissed it ... and made a wish ... it'd come true .	2, 7
And just how did he go about that ?	7
And [PERSON]'s sent you about a ton of tea . Well , a couple of pounds .	7
And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	7
And people do the strangest things , too .	7
And so I clicked it and ... There was the pictures of my daughter .	7
And the kid you're taking off ... you give him , .	7
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	7
And were you not told the same thing by his wife ?	7
And what do you think those old geezers really miss in [LOCATION] ?	7
And what happens Tuesday ?	7
And you believe that ?	7
And you found out ?	7
And you know what ? They offered us a job .	7
And you shouldn't neglect your gums .	7
And you were right there !	7
And you're it .	7
Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	7
Anyone'd think you didn't want to get better .	7
Apparently [PERSON] smells like [LOCATION] too .	7
Are they all hollow shells ? !	7
Are they both mad ?	7
Are we here at the mechanic ?	7
Are we killers now ?	7

Aren't you pleasant . - Yes , when I wan na be .	7
Aren't you tired , [PERSON] ?	7
As far as discretion goes , what were you and [PERSON] doing , comparing notes ?	7
As far as I'm concerned , a coconut hit you on the mouth .	7
Ass cam . - What ?	7
At first I was like , Why did I run away ?  	7
At the moment , you have an excellent chance of being hanged .	7
Autumn ?	7

Boy , you amaze me .	7
Boy , you got hands of gold .	8, 7
British Intelligence showed you the letter for the first time in [LOCATION] ?	2, 7
But and the Duchess ?	2, 7
But are they telling me , or are they asking me ?	7
But do you truly believe that by deliberate present - day action we can neutralize that possibility and alter the future ?	7
But everyone pretended he could walk ?	7
But how can there be a question ?	7
But how do you know that if you weren't there ?	7
But how do you live there all by yourself ?	7
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies .	7
But I couldn't help noticing , despite the habit , that you're quite young .	7
But I didn't sleep yet .	7
But I don't know anything about [LOCATION] .	2, 7
But I think you'll enjoy his game .	2, 7
But I want to know why .	7
But I'm her spiritual adviser .	7
But if you're in love with him , why are you skipping out ?	7
But [PERSON] told me she was with you .	7
But right now , I can't think of one .	7
But the windows will ?	7
But there's no dirt in here . - I know .	7
But these are criminals .	7
But they were lights , they were flying around .	7
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	7
But what's she doing off of [LOCATION] with part of that fleet's treasure ?	7
But what's wrong with Sister [PERSON]'s habit ?	7
But where have I put it ?	7
But who would buy the boat ?	7
But why do you bring this up now ?	7
But you are absolutely sure he was a priest ?	7
But , monsieur , if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul .	7
By heavens , an Englishwoman .	7
Calm down , chica . She only owes me more .	7
Cam ?	7
Can it be that I'm falling in love with you ?	7
Can we even do this ?	7
Can you ever imagine [PERSON] being in a spot like that ?	7
Can you imagine that guy ?	7
Can't I go down to [LOCATION] and get it fixed ?	7
Can't I have everything ?	7
Can't you tell me what's happened ?	7
[PERSON] really digs you .	7
[PERSON] never seemed worried about anything like that .	7
Case , it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this .	7
Caught in the act .	7
[PERSON] , it's me . - Yeah .	7
[PERSON] , she's got tits the size of cucumbers .	7
Christ !	7

Do you really want to know ?	7
Do you speak english ? - ( speaks spanish )	7
Does it mean you want me to go there ?	7
Does not this makes you laugh ?	7

It ain't fitting ' , it just ain't fitting ' .	3
It can look like [PERSON]'s knickers for all I care , just as long as I get off this stinking boat !	3
It can't be so hard to die .	3
It can not sit down in wet cushions .	3
It depends on what you're looking for .	3
It has happened to me without my wanting , almost without my knowing .	3
It is a crime that happens against children in every neighborhood , in every city and state in the country .	1, 3, 4
It is a lot of crap , sir .	3
It is absurd !	3
It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is .	3, 7

It is my prison .	3
It is not educated . Then it repents .	8, 1, 3
It is of no concern to me	3
It is time for the Torlato - Favrinis to get off the world .	1, 3

It's a bit like Monopoly , only more people get hurt .	3
It's a dead man .	3
It's a disease .	3
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do .	3
It's a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison .	3
It's a shame , isn't it ?	3, 6
It's all bullshit .	3
It's all for show .	3
It's all my fault .	3, 6
It's all that's left of him now . Just a box of bits and pieces .	3
It's an incredibly profitable , as horrifying as it is to say , business .	3, 7
It's an insult .	3
It's an old saying by an old crow .	3
It's because of you people that I can not get outside !	3
It's blackmail , pure and simple .	3
It's cold .	3, 6
It's crazy .	3

It's disrespectful .	3
It's freedom for a woman to spread her legs like that on a magazine ?	3

It's just all too much right now . You know , I just ...	1, 3
It's like being in jail .	3
It's like having a beast ... wild within me ,	3, 4
It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	3, 6
It's me , you fool .	1, 3, 5
It's no use anyway .	3, 6
It's not going to go that far .	3
It's not like they'll miss it .	3
It's not right to leave it in there .	3, 4, 6
It's not that easy to kill someone and get away with it .	3
It's over .	3, 4, 6

It's pretty awful .	1, 3
It's such a ridiculous ...	3
It's superficial .	3
It's terribly expensive here , [PERSON] .	3
It's the saga of a man with very little charm and even less courage .	3
It's the son of a bitch who painted this car , that's who . Yeah , that's what a real criminal is .	3
It's time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands .	3
It's time you woke up to your responsibilities .	3
It's too bad .	3, 6
It's ugly , old and musty .	3

Junior's gonna be a convict before he's in third grade !	3, 4
Just a man with a poor taste in beers .	3
Just another white guy waiting for the train .	3
Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy .	3
Just because it is big and white and a yacht , is it not still dirt ?	1, 3, 7

Maybe she even killed my partner , [PERSON] .	1, 3
Maybe you can hear this . The next time you cross me , you're gonna turn up missing .	3
Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client .	1, 3
Maybe your master knows the answer to that one too , or maybe he doesn't want to know .	2, 3, 6, 7
Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	3
[PERSON] , I don't mind you being stupid , but this is crazy .	3

I'm trapped .	4
I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan .	4, 7
I'm worried about the future , and what people will think .	4
I'm . . I no m. . mean to .	4

I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] .	4, 7
I've been robbed .	4
I've got a little problem .	2, 4
I've got every man on it , but without FBI or locals , we're carrying a handicap .	4
I've got to get out before he gets back !	4
I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story , but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government !	1, 2, 4
I've just been bitten by a snake .	4
I've just heard a startling piece of news .	4
I've no other place to go .	4

I've put the gun down .	4
I've , uh , really enjoyed this little chat .	4
If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ?	1, 2, 4, 7
If anyone looks like they know you ...	4
If [PERSON] sees a phone company subpoena , now , she'll bust a gut .	4
If he found out , he'd insist upon doing it himself if he had the money , which I doubt .	4
If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out !	4
If I give them any trouble , they cut me .	4
If I go , you'll ruin me .	4
If I let go , I'll fall !	4
If I miss that meeting , I'll lose about half next year's sales commissions .	4

If it wouldn't be too much trouble .	8, 4
If [PERSON]'s found dead , that'll make for more questions and deeper probes .	4
If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ?	2, 4, 6, 7
If one of them followed you , there's got to be more of them around .	4
If she succeeds , the consequences will be disastrous .	4
If that's true , we were guilty .	2, 4, 6
If the city can pay , we'll be humiliated .	2, 4, 6
If the strychnine was not in the coffee and we know that it was not in the cocoa , where it was ?	4
If they find out you're FBI , we have a problem .	4
If they track you down , it wouldn't be our doing .	4
If things don't work out ...	4
If we close , our stock won't be worth a nickel .	4
If we didn't have a price on our heads , we'd get out of this hole .	4
If we do this , we're in trouble .	4
If we don't get that money , how's [PERSON] gonna go to seattle ?	4
If we keep our stern to the wind , we'll roll over .	4
If we let him live , could he forgive us ?	4
If we lose , get out of town quick .	4
If we push this , who are we pushing against ?	2, 4
If we quit , some Federal judge take away your money .	4
If we screw up graduation , we'll have to take basics all over again .	4
If we yield to blackmail from this man , we'll become a laughing stock !	4
If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory , it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage .	2, 4
If you bleed , you'll get an infection .	4
If you do that you'll get nothing , except maybe the police after you .	4
If you don't find [PERSON]'s killer , we are both history .	4
If you don't hurry ...	4
If you drop any charges against [PERSON] , we'll drop the lawsuit against you .	8, 4
If you know where she is , I beg you to tell me now before it's too late .	4
If you print anything now , I'll be exposed .	4
If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project , this bullet has your name on it , and it will find you .	1, 4
If you want him to die , shoot now .	1, 4
If you're guides there , I'll kill your family .	1, 4
If you're standing where [PERSON] was , you're gonna drown .	4
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in .	4
In hours every hit man in [LOCATION] will be here . I seriously doubt that .	4
In a shootout , five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ...	1, 4, 6
In fact I should .	8, 4
In the dream , the destroyer's destroyed .	4
In the meantime , I'll be dead .	4
In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships .	8, 4
Inside there's a huge creature	2, 4
[LOCATION]'s been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there .	4
Is anybody hurt ?	4
Is anyone down there ?	4
Is he all right ?	4
Is he dead ?	2, 4, 6
Is he gonna be a problem ?	1, 2, 4, 7
Is he gonna be okay ?	4, 6
Is it bleeding ?	4
Is it worth the risk of a scandal ?	4
Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	4
Is [PERSON] really dead ?	4, 6
Is Mommy going to be all right ?	4
Is something wrong ?	4
Is there no a door of another side ?	4
[PERSON] . [PERSON] , are you all right ?	4
Isn't it possible that some sort of external intelligence , some discarnate entity , has crossed into our plane of existence ?	4
Isn't [PERSON]'s death enough ?	4
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk ?	4
Isn't that terrible !	4
Isn't the reverse possible ?	2, 4
It ain't safe to go that way ...	4
It all began one night when the lights went out. ,	2, 4
It can only blow up in our faces .	4
It can't be a coincidence it lays out this way , [PERSON] .	4
It concerns me !	4
It could break us financially .	4, 6
It could get you in trouble .	4
It could have been a dead end .	4
It could still come back at any time	4
It couldn't have been me , sir .	4
It doesn't fear my incantations !	4
It don't hurt having ' an angel on your side .	8, 4
It don't look good , Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one .	8, 4
It felt like an earthquake .	4
It hurts !	1, 4, 7
It is being covered up , but , probably not for the reasons you might think .	2, 4
It is he .	4
It is infernal !	1, 4, 7
It is spoken on all channels .	8, 4
It is the monster !	4
It kills many brave men .	4
It looks like a life sentence .	4
It makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone .	4
It may bring you serious trouble .	4
It may endanger the very peace and stability of [LOCATION] .	4
It means , um ... if you say anything about this , - your ass is grass . - Okay .	1, 4
It might get infected .	4
It must be serious .	4
It put the rope to the neck !	1, 4
It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing .	4
It sounds frightening .	4
It sounds to me like you have an agenda .	4
It tried to kill my Raymond !	4
It was a nightmare .	4
It was an accident .	4
It was an avalanche .	4
It was horrible there .	4
It was just ... something happened that ... hasn't happened in like years .	4, 6, 7
It was really hard .	4, 7
It wasn't her fault , honest it wasn't .	4
It will be difficult for me . Suppose ...	4
It will get me in much trouble .  	4, 6
It will make them sick .	4
It ... it's gonna be okay .	4
It'll get cold .	4
It'll only get you in trouble .	4
It'll probably kill me , too .	4
It's a big mistake .	4
It's a cruel disease .	4
It's a damn nightmare .	4
It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners .	1, 2, 4
It's a matter of life and death !	1, 4
It's a matter of life and death .	4
It's a monster !	4
It's a passion that continues to grow , ... The more the King is drowning .	4
It's a shark !	4
It's a train robbery .	4
It's a trap .	4
It's a wonder we make a profit at all .	4
It's all been like a crazy nightmare .	4
It's all coming apart , Al.	4, 6
It's all right , don't shoot !	4
It's already on the : news .	4
It's awfully quaint , isn't it ?	4
It's bad there .	4
It's bad .	8, 4
It's black smoke .	4
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	4
It's dangerous .	4
It's difficult holding her .	4
It's going to be a disaster .	4, 6
It's gonna be a massacre .	4
It's gonna be a treacherous hike .	2, 4
It's gonna take some getting used to , isn't it ?	2, 4
It's her !	4, 5, 7
It's horrible .	4
It's just that ... the breeding is no longer working .	4
It's just when you say these things are closing in on me , it's like a nightmare .	4
It's just -- it's hard sometimes .	4, 6
It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't -- He don't know why we're here .	4
It's like that time in [LOCATION] when he made me walk ... stripped down to only my long - handles and my hat .	4
It's like they're after me , right ?	4
It's looking for us .	4
It's not an easy thing to do .	4, 6
It's not enough .	4, 6
It's not going to be a problem , is it , [PERSON] ?	4
It's not going to be easy .	4
It's not like that .	4
It's not mine , man .	4
It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	4
It's not safe .	4
It's not what you think . I - I - I would never ... Please , [PERSON] .	4, 6
It's only temporary , you know ?	8, 2, 4
It's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded .	4, 6
It's something I couldn't discuss with anyone .	4
It's three years since my last confession .	4
It's ticking like a bomb .	4
It's too dangerous , it's utterly unpredictable .	4
It's too late to start anything now .	4
It's too late , isn't it ?	4
It's too late .	4
It's too risky .	4
It's too young for a heart attack .	4
It's urgent !	4
It's you .	4
It's your gun , sir ?	4
[PERSON] , I warn you .	4

I'm sure I can do it .	5
I'm sure that in all [LOCATION] there's no empathicalist as charming as you .	5
I'm sure that's thanks to you as well .	5
I'm sure you'll be glad to know that law and order has come to [LOCATION] .	5
I'm taking a bath .	2, 5
I'm taking over the bridge .	2, 5
I'm telling you , it's gonna be all right .	8, 5
I'm the funny one .	8, 5
I'm thinking about my own ass .	5
I'm thinking about showing him and getting pregnant . Of course if I get pregnant I can't go to FATI .	2, 5
I'm very fond of my wife and kid .	5
I'm very happy to know you , sir .	5
I'm very pleased to meet you , sister [PERSON] .	5
I'm willing to keep the conversation going , - but in the meantime ...	2, 5
I'm with you .	8, 5
I'm worth the risk , you'll see .	2, 5
I've a great program to try out .	5
I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates .	8, 5
I've always been in love with you .	5
I've been building a reputation for years .	5
I've been building a reputation for 25 , years .	5
I've been missing you a lot lately .	8, 5, 6
I've been sleeping with women .	5
I've come to get you - it's my party .	2, 5
I've escaped !	5
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels .	5
I've got a plan .	2, 5
I've got cookies !	5
I've got some good wine .	5
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	5
I've got something down here .	2, 5
I've got tons of exotic destinations , faraway places , custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway .	2, 5
I've got you the assignment of your dreams !	2, 5
I've had a lot of fun , [PERSON] , I saw some shows , went to nightclubs .	5
I've had enough , thanks .	8, 5
I've looked all over for shoes like that .	2, 5, 7
I've never been happier in my life .	5
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	5
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are .	5
I've told you that he is what other men are not .	8, 5
If [PERSON]'s a good boy , he gets the jackpot .	2, 5
If he likes running his fingers through my hair , well , why not ?	5
If he made it , so can I !	5
If I see you in the stands , it make me feel better .	5
If I use my last wish ...	2, 5
If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	2, 5
If it's so beautiful down there , why ...	5
If there was a bum within miles , I was completely attracted to him .	3, 5, 6
If we can force them to come in and face us , we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape .	2, 3, 5
If you did your cheekbones better , you could look like [PERSON] .	5
If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress .	5, 7
If you need to take a break , you can .	8, 5
If you start to hesitate , call me .	2, 5
If you worked for the imperial court your future would be boundless	2, 5
If your mother were alive , she'd be so happy .	5
In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club .	5
In case I want to read it more than once .	2, 5
In fact , I admire the style of you .	5
In fact , I'm just about to haul nuggies .	5
In my dreams I saw a light over [LOCATION] and I knew there was hope .	5
In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless , graceful harmony .	5
In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	5
In the final analysis , all we're trying to do is create a happy world .	5
In the garden of a convent in [LOCATION] , there's a beautiful statue .	5
In the last two years of his life , he gave away most of his fortune ... in large , anonymous donations , to your charity .	2, 5, 7
In the summertime , at sunset , the whole beach looks incredible .	5
In this business , one should joke a little .	5
Is her lover . He comes over .	5, 7
Is it not fortunate , for instance , that I own the newspapers in my country ?	5
Is it ... and look who's there !	5, 7
Is that a fine - lookin' woman or what ?	5
Is this a beautiful castle ?	5
Isabelle !	5
[PERSON] . [PERSON] ! It's finished .	5, 7

Isn't that pretty ?	5
Isn't that wonderful , father ?	5
Isn't that wonderful ?	5
Isn't this exciting ?	2, 5
Isn't this fun ?	5
Isn't this just fabulous ?	5
I'll never get this . We're doomed !	4, 6
I'll never have a girl like that 	6
I'll never see you again .	6
I'll start weeping with self - pity any minute .	6
I'm a sex trafficking survivor .	5, 6
I'm a sick man .	6
I'm a three - time loser , [PERSON] .	6
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	6
I'm afraid I'm not a very good host .	6
I'm afraid I've disappointed you .	6
I'm afraid it's all my fault .	6
I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot .	6
I'm afraid the press has been alerted to your mother's presence here ... - ... and her arrest . - Oh , great .	3, 6
I'm afraid we lost our patient .	6
I'm afraid we must go , dear .	6
I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6
I'm awfully sorry , darling .	6
I'm awfully sorry .	6
I'm awfully unhappy , Mom .	6
I'm broke .	6
I'm cold	6
I'm cold .	6
I'm distraught to hear that .	6
I'm falling ...	6
I'm flying under false colours , Miss [PERSON] .	3, 6
I'm getting numb all over .	4, 6, 7
I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	4, 6
I'm going now to the church for confession .	4, 6
I'm going to have to leave the country if I ever want a breath of air .	6
I'm going to jump .	6
I'm going to need you to put your hands up .	8, 1, 6
I'm gonna kill myself .	6
I'm grounded .	6
I'm here to tell you you've made your point .	8, 6
I'm hungry .	6
I'm hurt and ...	6
I'm in bad shape .	6
I'm in rehab ?	4, 6, 7
I'm involved with someone else .	6
I'm just an old farm boy .	6
I'm just as old as I look .	6
I'm just not up to my usual self .	6
I'm just so scared .	4, 6
I'm just starting to feel like ... Pretty alone .	6
I'm just tired .	1, 3, 6
I'm just ... so frustrated .	1, 3, 6
I'm leaving you , my dear .	6
I'm leaving .	6
I'm not at my best over the phone .	6
I'm not doing it alone .	4, 6, 7
I'm not feeling well . This won't take long .	6
I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	6
I'm not lying .	1, 6
I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	8, 1, 4, 6
I'm not playing at being provost marshal . And I never heard of luck that didn't run out .	1, 6
I'm not ready to retire yet .	6
I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog .	6
I'm not sure how much good all this talking's doing .	6
I'm not usually this fragile .	6
I'm not very good at that .	6
I'm obsolescing like this old straw - bottomed cruiser of ours .	6
I'm out of my mind ?	6
I'm really not sure .	6, 7
I'm really sorry , Mr. [PERSON] .	6
I'm really sorry .	6
I'm sentimental about old people .	6
I'm sick and tired of this delay .	6
I'm sick .	6
I'm so ashamed .	6
I'm so clumsy . I'm sorry .	3, 6
I'm so pissed at you ! I'm really pissed , OK ?	1, 3, 6
I'm so sorry , grandma . No one wanted to tell you , but you're dying .	6
I'm so sorry .	6
I'm sorry about the shoes .	6
I'm sorry about this .	6
I'm sorry about your father .	6
I'm sorry for you .	6
I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6
I'm sorry I don't have one for you .	6
I'm sorry I snapped at you .	6
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print .	6
I'm sorry that I could not divulge the truth to you of all men .	6
I'm sorry they don't like me .	6
I'm sorry this had to happen , [PERSON] .	6
I'm sorry to disturb you .	6
I'm sorry to have bothered you .	6
I'm sorry to hear about your little loss .	6
I'm sorry to hear that , Lady Fingers .	6
I'm sorry to hear that , Mr. [PERSON] .	6
I'm sorry to hear that .	6
I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance .	3, 6
I'm sorry , gentlemen ...	6
I'm sorry , Grandfather . I've got to get some air .	3, 6
I'm sorry , [PERSON] .	3, 6
I'm sorry , I didn't mean to , you know ...	6
I'm sorry , I didn't think .	6
I'm sorry , I have a bill ...	6
I'm sorry , I'm sorry .	6
I'm sorry , maybe you don't want any company .	6
I'm sorry , Rock .	6
I'm sorry , sir .	6
I'm sorry , the coffee's gone .	6
I'm sorry , there's nothing I can do . You'll have to kill your dog .	6
I'm sorry . I'm just frustrated .	3, 6
I'm sorry . I'm sorry .	6
I'm supposed to be taking care of you .	8, 1, 6
I'm sure you don't mean that .	6
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8, 6
I'm talking too much .	6
I'm telling you , I thought I was the best .	6
I'm terribly sorry .	6
I'm the last installment and that troubles me .	6
I'm tired of being only three inches high .	6
I'm tired .	2, 6
I'm too old to be traded in .	6
I'm too tired .	6
I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	6
I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	6
I'm unhappy .	6
I'm very sorry about that , Miss.[LOCATION] . .	6
I'm very upset , [PERSON] .	1, 6
I'm ... I'm sorry .	6
I've been aboard the [PERSON] too long .	3, 6
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again .	6
I've been having weather problems .	6
I've been in all night .	6
I've been sick , [PERSON] .	6
I've been stuck here for 20 , years .	6
I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out .	6
I've been trying to find you , but ...	6
I've even ... Maybe you won't admit it , but you love me . - [PERSON] .	6
I've got a headache , [PERSON] .	6
I've got a scar .	6
I've got bad news for you , GJ .	6
I've got to go to [LOCATION] , first plane .	6
I've had a very trying evening .	6
I've had the flu .	6
I've lied and used people all my life because I thought everybody did .	6
I've lost , pounds on the horses .	6
I've missed so much !	6
I've never been dumped before , that ... didn't feel awesome .	6
I've never before known anyone who was really brave .	6
I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today .	1, 3, 6
I've never tried to kill myself successfully .	6
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years .	6
If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	6
If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do .	6, 7
If I could only close my eyes for a few hours .	6
If I spoke , you barely answered .	6
If I told you what we've been through ...	6
If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here .	6
If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of , I would be willing to share all this ... My records , everything .	6
If only I'd done a better job .	6
If she was young and beautiful , I forgive you .	8, 6
If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	6
If there were more time ...	6
If we could be like this forever it would be great	6
If we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers .	6
If you die , your type will be extinct	6
If you don't eat and sleep , you have to expect accidents like that .	6
If you would've had four fours , you would've won .	6
Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles .	6
In fact , we're so bad that we're disbanding .	6
In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap .	6
In the end , we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet .	6
In the last century , the islanders were starving .	6
In your world if The Neverending Story is fading no child will ever know about Junior .	6
Is it all gone ?	6
Is it that you think it'll be better for ... for all of us if you go away ?	6
Is not no one , who could take care of him ?	6
Is that it ?	6, 7
Is there no justice in the world ?	1, 3, 6, 7
Isn't that what's wrong with the world today ?	6
It adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I've become a little sentimental .	6
It affects her every day .	6
It ain't all that easy , son ....	6
It breaks my heart .	6
It could work if the government would spend more money .	6
It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now .	6
It does matter .	6
It doesn't happen often these days .	6
It doesn't have to be like this .	6
It doesn't make sense .	6
It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	1, 6
It drags at your heart till ... you can't do anything but look back .	6
It ended very badly .	6
It forces me to beg as a beggar .	6
It gives me a terrible pain .	6
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you , has it Mr. [PERSON] ?	6
It hasn't been easy , has it ?	6
It hurts a little .	6
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	6
It hurts , but he doesn't show it .	6
It hurts , hurts , hurts .	6
It is not a pivotal project in your career .	6
It is not the one .	6
It is probable that the last dose is fatal .	6
It is too expensive to maintain , [PERSON] !	6, 7
It isn't like it used to be .	6
It isn't that . It's what [PERSON] said .	6, 7
It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be .	6
It makes me sad .	6
It makes my heart sad .	6
It must be a mistake , he was clever ...	6, 7
It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful .	6, 7
It seems I try to do the impossible .	6
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	6
It sometimes never goes away . How you talk .	6
It takes away the pain .	6
It was awful !	6
It was blocking him from coming out .	6
It was certainly a heart attack !	6, 7
It's all here .	7
It's an investment ?	7
It's as if ordinary human beings , living ordinary lives , had suddenly vanished from the [LOCATION] , and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people .	7
It's back !	7
It's been over a week you've been gone .	7
It's been ... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work .	8, 5, 7
It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses , the more it makes , because of the carryovers with the write - offs .	7
It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	7
It's getting real bright out here .	7
It's hard to believe about [PERSON] .	7
It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 , years .	7
It's hard to believe , isn't it ?	7
It's impossible !	7
It's impossible . [PERSON] ...	6, 7
It's impossible . Now time is up , [LOCATION]'s doing it's audit .	1, 6, 7
It's incredible stupidity ...	1, 6, 7
It's just beginner's luck .	1, 6, 7
It's just me .	7
It's like they're running an errand , and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand .	7
It's [PERSON] ! [PERSON] from [LOCATION] .	2, 5, 7
It's me , [PERSON] .	2, 7
It's more than my job's worth !	1, 7
It's not all a lie , [PERSON] .	1, 6, 7
It's portable , long - range , very expensive .	8, 2, 7
It's somehow able to bend light .	7
It's the first time he's told me the truth !	7
It's unbelievable .	7
It's working .	5, 7
[PERSON] , aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry ?	7
[PERSON] , what happened ?	7
[PERSON] fucking christ . - $ ? - Yes , sir .	1, 7
[PERSON] , this is a fairly young guy .	7
Jesus !	7
Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	7
[PERSON] , are we leaving ?	7
[PERSON] ... ?	7
Joséphine ?	7
Judge , it's our theory that Mr. [PERSON] is being framed in this case .	7
Judges need to be educated , the public needs to be educated , the Department of Justice needs to be educated on exactly what's going on here .	6, 7
[PERSON] does not get on that helicopter with the Royals . Instead she goes over to [PERSON]'s house and tries to kill him ?	2, 7
Junior when are you going to learn the difference between a rock and a nose ?	1, 7
Just one ?	7
Just what is this relationship between you and our friend ?	7
Just when I think you're dead , you always come back .	7
Ka - rumph ! We were smashed to port .	1, 7
[PERSON] didn't even look at me .	7
knots through the harbour ?	7
[PERSON] , he shouldn't be up here .	1, 7
l pumped your stomach . Oh , God .	4, 7
Lacy , watch out !	4, 7
Ladies , I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros .	8, 5, 7
Leader , party just got bigger .	7
LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED , UNDRESS , SHOWER , BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED	8, 2, 4, 7
Leon , why are you so good to us ?	7
Let me give you this watch .	5, 7
Let me have secrets .	7
Let me in ! Let me in !	7
Let's just time [PERSON] as he comes charging to the rescue ! - What's going on here ?	7
Let's not get carried away here .	7
Let's put this on your wrist . What is that ? Ok , this is a digital heart monitor .	4, 7
Lieutenant , what the hell is that thing ?	1, 7
Like [PERSON] lost control ?	7
Like one time , I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked , except he still had his socks on .	7
Like what ?	7
Like your shoes , it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did .	7
Listen to this , there were some hard drives in the copy store that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer .	7
Listen , today is my birthday and the girls give me a party .	7
Look at all that underwear .	7
Look at all these happy families .	7
Look at you , baby girl ! Hey , you ready to blow this joint or what ?	8, 2, 5, 7
Look at your eyes !	7
Look how big it is !	7
Look how I've changed !	5, 7
Look out below !	7
Look what just came in .	7
Look what's in the street .	2, 4, 7
Look , a fist !	7
Look , I won !	5, 7
Look , it's [PERSON] !	7
Look , look , this would be the greatest discovery in the history of science .	7
Look , money !	7
Look , you can't dwell on what you hoped was gonna happen with [PERSON] .	6, 7
Look !	5, 7
Look . Look ! Look !	7
Looks a lot like your house , doesn't it ?	7
Looks like he's in great shape , don't he ?	7
Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh . - Dress it . Quickly .	1, 7
Looks like we got a slumber party on the third floor .	7
Looks like we're going that way .	7
Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] !	7
[PERSON] , don't you have your own secretary ?	7
lt was [PERSON] . - How do you - l tailed him .	7
Lucito , huh ?	7
Mac ...	7
Madame is canceling the engagement ?	7
Madame , if you don't think about food , what do you think about ?	7
Magic ?	7
Majesty I can present ... my young daughter , the new Countess of [PERSON] ?	2, 7
Make your wish .	8, 2, 5, 7
Man , he is a lot bigger .	7
Man , I always thought it was the mezcal talking , but after seeing this , I think he was right .	8, 7
Many of you aren't wearing battle gear .	6, 7
[PERSON] , nice to meet you .	5, 7
[PERSON] -[PERSON] , how do you do ?	7
Mark : There's a big wind coming !	7
[PERSON] has disappeared .	1, 4, 6, 7
Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	7
[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	7
Maybe he'd better start carrying his own matches . Oh ?	7
Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't .	7
Maybe I should just go back to the clinic ?	2, 7
Maybe it's me and [PERSON] .	7
Maybe she has a sister .	2, 7
Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids .	7
Maybe they're buddies after all .	7
Maybe you sleep together once in a while .	7
Me not work ?	7
[PERSON] , are you OK ?	8, 4, 6, 7
[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	7
Miss what ?	7
Miss [PERSON] is going with you ?	7
Mom . Nice to see you . - Hello .	2, 5, 7
Mommy ! Mom !	8, 5, 7
[PERSON] , my man .	5, 7
More than two ?	7
More ! - More ?	7
Mother of God . [PERSON] ' dog ? - You said pig .	1, 7
Mr who ?	7
Mr. [PERSON] ? It's been so long . I almost didn't recognize you .	7
Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	7
Mr. [PERSON]'s changed with the times .	7
Mr. [PERSON] , do you think really that I could be a star ?	7
Mr. [PERSON] knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question .	6, 7
Mr. [PERSON] , it seems that [PERSON]'s mother was murdered by [PERSON]'s father .	7
Mr. [PERSON] wants to know how come he don't know you .	5, 7
Mrs [PERSON] , do you know what you just ordered ?	7
Mrs. [PERSON] !	2, 5, 7
Ms. [PERSON] ... everybody has a secret face .	7
Ms. [PERSON] , this is an outrageous situation .	7
Must have been degrees to the shadow ! There was no a cloud in the sky .	1, 2, 7
Must have been watching out that window for hours .	7
My brother took all your cigarettes ? I have another pack .	8, 1, 6, 7
My club ? Really ?	5, 7

In other words , these guys got to get out of their ivory towers .	1
In [LOCATION] ... I need a man able to impress them .	1, 2
In spite of glasnost , my friend's novel can not yet be published ... in the [LOCATION] .	1

In the old days when we nicked someone no one got hurt , and no one lost anything very much .	1
In this order we're not allowed personal possessions . Nor are we .	1

Isn't it hideously plain to the naked eye I'm in love with you ?	1
Issues ? Bullshit .	1
It ain't worth it .	1
It can't be that difficult .	1
It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or , you can see all of the evidence and you can not feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right .	1
It don't do nothing for me .	1
It is for Mr [PERSON] . Only for Mr [PERSON] .	1, 2
It is not my [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	1

It is out of the question .	1
It is time to fight .	1, 2
It is useless to ask .	1
It isn't , and you're gonna erase it !	1
It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	1
It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	1
It upsets me that you suspect him , even for a second .	1
It was disapproved of by the Party .	1
It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass .	1
It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	1, 6, 7
It was self - defence , for [PERSON]'s sake !	1
It was them that fucked up .	1
It wasn't up to my mother .	1, 6
It wasn't worth it .	1
It will be refused , the Lady Tadminster it can open the party in the first day , and you .	1
It would be a start if you'd let [PERSON] go .	1
It'll make you cry .	1
It's a background check .	1
It's a crime against the people who sent me here !	1
It's a crime against the people who sent me here ! We are on an official mission ... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors .	1
It's a question of principle .	1
It's a very busy time right now .	1
It's about time .	1
It's against Navy regulations .	1
It's all that ghost's fault	1
It's all your fault .	1
It's an expression .	1
It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing .	1, 2
It's because he's relentless .	1
It's better than dying in some dirty hotel .	1, 2, 6
It's [PERSON] .	1
It's fine , we're leaving ,	1
It's fucking embarrassing .	1
It's gonna cost him more than that .	1
It's him I'm asking , [PERSON] , not you . See ?	1
It's impossible to make a real dent . But it is possible to hurt individual assholes who fuck it up for everyone .	1

It's just the beginning .	1, 5
It's my mission , for six months ... Shut it !	1
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to	1

It's not negotiable , [PERSON] .	1
It's not [LOCATION] .	1
It's not so simple . What the hell isn't so simple ?	1
It's not that you fuck around a lot . It's that you lie about it .	1
It's Oextry I want to see squirm .	1
It's on the map as being here .	1
It's out of the question , Mr. [PERSON] .	1

One of my biggest disappointments over the last years is those who lack the courage of their convictions .	1, 3, 6, 7
One of the theories we have is that Backpage is , in fact , in a conspiracy with the pimps , that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking , but in fact , are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement .	1, 3
One of these days , when I get my boat built I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory .	1

I've been waiting to speak to you , Father .	2
I've come to take care of you and your brother .	2
I've decided to go to [LOCATION] , just like I made it up in a story .	2
I've got it ...	2
I've got Scotch , I've got vodka , there's a nice Chablis ...	2
I've got to appoint a new senator .	2
I've got to get a contract signed .	2

If he resists , arrest him .	2
If I ask you to kill someone ?	2
If I find anything out before you get back , I'll telephone you here .	2
If I get the job , I'll buy you one hundred of 'em .	2
If I get this shot , you'll like it a lot better , right ?	2
If I hadn't seen you on the news , I wouldn't have known who his partner was .	2, 7
If I hurry , perhaps I might even be home in time for tea .	2
If I'm going to vote , I ought to study some of the bills .	2
If it's more important than golf , go ahead .	2
If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you .	2
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2
If that's true ... this should be very exciting .	2
If the check hasn't cleared , we can still get out of it .	2
If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2
If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ?	2, 7
If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals .	2
If we find him , we can deal with the High Priest	2
If we take them out now , they can fight again tomorrow .	2
If you and [PERSON]'ll gab on about this appointment , I'll see the committees .	2
If you can get to his phones , we'll have our leads .	2
If you come with me into the other room , I'll show you my idea ... if you'll show me yours .	2
If you don't mind , I'm gonna sit right here , catch myself a breeze or two , and then I'll be on my way .	2
If you insist , I'll have eight more .	2
If you let me stay with you , I'll tell you .	2
If you press here , you can make drawings .	2
If you're going to wonder , let's go and do it over a steak .	2

In here ! Quickly !	2
In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world .	2
In the ?	2
In the dirt , it's hard to tell .	2
In the first place , this young lady is under exclusive contract to Mr. [PERSON] , of course , and he can not discuss her future availability at this time .	2
In the interest of the West's greatest horse , the bronco and myself , who grows them , I'm putting up an extra $ 1,000 , to the bronco rider who wins !	2
In the ring , it's like all I see is him .	2
Interesting problem we got on this one :	2
Is he well ?	2
Is it important ?	2
Is that all right with you ?	2
Is that all ?	2
Is there anybody here ?	2, 7
Is there anything else you'd like to know about me ?	2
Is there something I can do for you ?	2
Is this the greatest day in your career ?	2
ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA .	2, 7
Isn't that the young woman who was staying in your house ?	2

It could give us time to bring our carriers within range .	2
It doesn't matter how long it takes , we'll be back in business .	2
It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	2, 5
It had to be filled with love .	2, 5
It is not usually he writes to me .	2
It is the first truly I did what I wanted .	2
It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours .	2, 5
It means we can get back before [PERSON] gets home .	2
It might help .	2, 5
It provides us that delicious house over there .	2, 7
It seems to me very clear .	2
It still has the keys , Mr. [PERSON] ? - Oui .	2, 7

It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two .	2
It's interesting .	2
It's just that we have our annual audit coming up and I thought I should probably stay put .	2
It's kicks , but I'm not under contract to 'em and I got a strong feeling option time is right around the corner .	2
It's loaded .	2
It's my birthday . I thought I'd invite you for dinner .	2, 5
It's not a role . It's a job , a rent - paying job . Now come on ;	2, 5

I know you drink on the quiet , and I know how much you drink .	3
I know you women got ta pretend to be offended .	3
I lied .	3, 6
I love tits as much as any guy ... . . but why would I pay some hag money for some supernatural chicanery ... . . coupled with sagging , wrinkled boobs ?	3
I made a deal with a cop once .	3
I made some dumb mistakes ...	3, 6

I think I could turn and live with animals .	3
I think Mr [PERSON] is disturbed because he can't take you to the party and dance all over your feet .	3
I thought it read like a cheap , dime - store novel .	3
I told him his wife was a dyke .	3
I told you no liquor in the office .	3
I treat her like what she is to me , nothing .	3
I wan na know whose idea it was to have children .	3

I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	3
I was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .	3, 6
I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free [LOCATION] ... from an unclean tyrant .	3
I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you !	3
I will show you freaky ...	3
I wish it were anybody's child but yours !	3
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face .	3
I wonder how she likes it now , being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl .	3
I work with a junkie ?	3, 7
I wouldn't dream of using such a tool .	3, 4
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp !	3
I wouldn't trust you with gold . That's why this is only worth a penny .	8, 3
I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him .	3
I'll be forced to shoot you again .	3
I'll be sick ...	3
I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something .	3
I'll be the man .	8, 3
I'll blacken this punk so he'll ...	3
I'll disinherit him .	3
I'll never eat fish again .	3
I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls !	3
I'll swear that into my own grave .	3
I'll teach you to make meaningless small talk to everyone ...	3
I'm ashamed of you , [PERSON] .	3
I'm ashamed of you .	3
I'm ashamed to put a picture of [PERSON] in a room like this .	3
I'm behaving like years old .	3
I'm getting leery of this guy .	3
I'm going to puke	3
I'm gonna be sick .	3
I'm gonna get that bastard .	3
I'm gonna take him back to the orphanage .	3
I'm gonna tell .	3
I'm gonna vomit .	3
I'm headed for hell anyway	3
I'm in the shithouse .	3
I'm listening to you eat .	3
I'm not coming .	3
I'm not going to the chair 'cause that ape got trigger - happy !	3
I'm not interested in some monkey riding the horse .	3
I'm not proud of that .	3
I'm not some gun for hire .	3
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	3
I'm not the same pathetic , trusting fool that I was a couple of days ago .	3
I'm old enough to be your mother , almost .	3
I'm pleased to meet you , ugly wop son of a bitch .	3
I'm really tempted to take you along with me ... but I'm just afraid that I'd awaken some morning ... and find you'd made a necklace with my teeth .	3
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him .	3
I'm so bored with this face .	3
I'm stuck with guys down here that are too dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill .	3
I'm such a pain in the ass these days I deserve myself .	3
I'm sure you feel the same about me , so let's stay out of each other's way .	3
I'm telling you , this cocksucker's trouble .	3
I'm tired of this baby crap !	3
I'm uncomfortable with whatever this is .	3
I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	3
I've been looking for you all over , hoping you were dead .	3
I've been to that scumbag town .	3
I've had a thousand chances to kill you , dirty , sell out cop .	3
I've isolated her forever .	3
I've lost another man and that bastard thinks it's funny .	3
I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .	3
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch .	3
Idiot !	3
Idle boasting , I assure you .	3
If a man shall be drunk on duty , he shall receive the same fate .	3
If [PERSON] comes back , I'll give him a bust right in the mouth .	3
If ever a funeral laid an egg , that one did .	3
If he can't find enough facts to break you with , I'll give him a couple .	3
If I catch any of you guys in my stuff , I'll kill you .	3
If I didn't love these boys so much , I think I'd kill them myself .	3
If I have to compete with someone , you might let me start on even terms .	3
If I thought I made you feel like that , I'd kill myself .	3
If it's so nutritious , how come I don't see you eating it ?	3
If that slob was a penologist , I'm a jet airplane pilot .	3
If there's any decency in you ...	3
If there's any justice , let him get mugged by the man who took my watch !	3
If they don't they may learn to appreciate it , but it will never become part of their soul .	3
If this guy has any information , why hasn't he contacted you already ?	3, 7
If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen .	3
If you can find a job , if it pays more than $ 50 , a week ... and if you don't get involved with another maniac .	3
If you discount the angina , the migraines and the gastritis , there's nothing wrong with me .	3
If you don't let go , I'll ...	3
If you don't tell me all you know , you become an accessory before the fact of murder .	3
If you ever talk to me like that again ... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life .	3
If you had any chivalry in you , or were nice ...	3
If you lay one finger on that poor , sweet , helpless girl ... you'll despise yourself forever .	3
If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart ...	3
If you're dirty , you're going .	3
Ignore that beast , [PERSON] . You joined the church Because you had no talents , no skills ,	3
Imagine getting gussied up like this to watch a lot of Supreme Court judges chew .	3
In case it slipped your mind , it's gunnery stations at .	3
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place .	3
Indeed throughout the entire interview ... he insisted they call him [PERSON] which is his right name and refused to answer to the name of [PERSON] .  	3
Instant gratification takes too long .	3
Irritating little sod .	3
Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation That has taken everything else from me ...	3
Is not it so ?	3
Is that intelligent banking ?	3
Is that the only word your mind can understand ?	3
Is that what they taught you at Yale Law School ?	3

Nobody eats that shit .	3
Nobody knows what goes on inside a police car , right , [PERSON] ?	3
Nobody likes a whiner .	3
Nobody makes a fool out of my wife .	3
Not one word of what he's saying is being printed in that state !	3
Nothing at [LOCATION] .	3
Nothing but talk .	3
Nothing doing .	3
Nothing Mr. [PERSON] has to say means shit to you , does it , [PERSON] ?	3
Now he takes an utter stranger into the family .	3
Now I know exactly what you think of me , and why .	3
Now look at all this fucking mess !	3
Now we have all the assholes in one room .	3
Now we're even .	8, 3, 5
Now you're lying .	3
Now , don't be a child .	3
Now , I don't date teenagers .	3
Now , look . You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy , but I'm not even remotely interested .	3
Now , you got any more smart talk ?	3
Now ...	3
Obscenely decaying flesh .	3
Of course I'm sweating , you moron .	3
Oh yeah , that's you .	3
Oh , I'm sorry .	3, 6
Oh , it tastes bitter .	3
Oh , just things that little girls dream about .	3, 6, 7

Oh , sure . Cry all you want . 	3
Oh , this place is such a mess .	3
Oh , your parents should be ashamed of themselves	3, 6
OK , the same day , I'm reading the Post and there's this item on [PERSON] , the radio guy who does those gross jokes about [LOCATION] and the Betty Ford Center .	3
On the other hand , they do have some rather nasty habits .	3
Once that secret mentions the visit of the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space .	3
One of the many troubles with you , Harry , is , you never know where your movie scripts leave off and life begins .	3
One of you better tell the lieutenant that the waterhole I come by this morning is all muddied up .	3
One should be able to take care of one's possessions .	3
One that will scream in the middle of the night and you'll have to stumble downstairs in the dark and change his soiled diapers .	3, 6
Only a gourd - head would ask a stupid question like that .	3
Only whores smoke in public .	3
Open that door again , you'll run a 3 - legged race to the undertaker .	3
Or a liar .	3
Or are you lying ?	3
or even scrap 	3
Or it might've just fallen overboard dropped there by some drunken old rummy .	3
Or it's just [PERSON] that smells like street shit over there .	3
Or you can go straight back to your home on the streets .	3
Our assessment is , Your Honor , is that they are responsible , at least in part , for both the creation of these ads and for the development of these ads . they're actually instructions to pimps on how to post an ad that works .	3, 4

I'm just not certain it's the right thing .	4
I'm not certain there's a limit to what she'll do .	4
I'm not fit to be a senator !	4
I'm not opening that door and neither are you , and if you try ...	4

Maybe they heard something .	4
Maybe we're about to find out .	4
Maybe we've missed him already .	4
Maybe you can talk this over later in private , maybe .	4

That butcher , Eggers , he'll take 35 , head ... and butcher them himself .	4
That could take years ... cost millions of lives .	4
That explains why they didn't rape me right off .	4
That is a very deep cut .	4
That means we're in grave trouble .	4
That might not be the worst of it .	4
That puts quite a burden on the company .	4
That smell of death .	4
That storm is pretty bad .	4
That task force is headed this way .	4
That thing's not for real , is it ?	4

This looks like a mind - fuck to me .	4
This means [LOCATION] , for sure .	4
This thing that's killing your people and mine is from the other side .	4
This was not the plan .	4
Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand .	4
To be hypnotized indirectly is very common , but to be regressed indirectly is not only unusual but a little nerve - wracking .	4
To do that would cause worldwide panic .	4
To read something like that was , frankly , it was alarming to me .	4, 7
To tell the truth , [PERSON] , tonight we're a little bit nervous .	4
To tell you the truth , [LOCATION] frightens me .	4

We are going to explode ! All right . [PERSON] , .	4
We are in great danger .	4
We are so late already .	4
We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	4
We could have been killed .	4
We didn't hear that .	4
We didn't pass that cutoff , did we ?	4
We don't know what we're dealing with .	4
We don't know where the hell we are .	4, 6
We don't -- we don't wan na do this but ...	4, 6

We got to save her !	4
We have a complication .	4
We have an emergency .	4
We have no choice but to use every conceivable weapon if they land .	4
We have to get her to a doctor .	4, 6
We haven't enough fuel to hold the keel down .	4
We just found out they were lost !	4
We know next to nothing about them except we believe they're connected to the Hezbollah .	4
We lost [PERSON] !	4, 6, 7
We may have another shark problem .	4
We may have made a mistake .	4
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	4

We take this , they'll booger us forever !	4
We thought they might be weapons directed against us .	4
We throw ourselves at your mercy .	4
We went to the very heart of the vessel ... The propulsion unit .	4, 6
We were a bit worried about you .	4
We were scared to hell .	4
We were wandering around , that's how we got robbed .	4
We were worried about [PERSON] .	4
We weren't even sure others existed .	4
We weren't trying to escape .	4
We whispered your names when we were kids ... scared to say them out loud .	4
We wouldn't last more than hours before we had a fatal accident !	4
We , uh , have several people in mind .	4, 7
We ... we have a few more questions to ask .	4
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	4
We'll make it to [LOCATION] if you're not careful !	4
We'll never get to the airport .	4
We're all gonna die !	4
We're all gonna die .	4, 6

We're so damn lost .	4
We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments .	8, 4
We've created a problem .	4
We've got to get out of here .	4
We've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity .	4
We've got to get this man off the floor .	4

We've made a mistake .	4
We've managed to keep it quiet , but if anyone knows , there'll be a SWAT team here .	4

I know what it meant to you .	8, 6
I know you think I'm crazy .	6
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	6, 7
I know . I miss him too .	6
I left my home simply because I had to leave .	6
I live in one room for 8 , years and I'm tired of it .	6
I looked everywhere for my wife but couldn't find her .	6
I lost my head for a moment , but I couldn't help it .	6
I lost my place .	6
I loved him , but you know ...	6
I mean that all my life I've been nothing .	6
I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	6
I mean , it wasn't a bad little table .	6
I might not get you back this time .	6
I miss the time when I had you to myself every day .	6
I miss you too .	6
I mistakenly trusted these demons and slaughtered righteous officials To atone for my sins	6
I must be going senile .	6
I must come clean , though . I I had a man in my bed last night .	6
I must go .	6
I must have worn out your machine .	6
I must not get too close to women	6
I never had the chance to apologize to her .	6
I never see anything happen .	6
I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd .	6
I never thought I'd see the day . Will you move over June , I can't see my knockout of a granddaughter ?	6
I never wrote it .	6, 7
I once went without food for 147 , days .	6
I only saw her when the family rented a farm in the summer .	6
I ought never to have married [PERSON] .	6
I promised myself when I get out of jail , I'm gonna find a Vago .	6
I promised your father I'd take care of you .	6
I read it in a report this morning and ...	6
I really am nice , but you act like a fool around me .	6
I really belong in jail .	6
I really liked him . I did .	6
I really missed you .	6
I remember very little of my childhood .	6
I said Because your husband is dead . 	6
I said to mama I don't feel good .	6
I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been or at least once a week .	6
I saw her just once more after that wedding night .	6
I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	6
I saw the little girl was hurt .	6
I screamed , but no one listened .	6
I see 'em walking around the streets depressed all the time .	6
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars ... and dreams of victory .	6
I shall always think about it .	6
I shall miss you too .	6
I should stay where I belong .	6
I shoulda listened to you .	6
I shouldn't have hit [PERSON] , shouldn't have picked up the telephone ...	6
I spent most of my life in institutions .	6
I still haven't recovered No energy to jump	6
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death .	6
I suppose that she forgot or he did not think that it might die .	6
I think an apology ...	6
I think I care too much .	6
I think I hurt him .	6
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	6
I think some were stolen .	6
I think that I'm pretty enough , but I would not want to be that kind of star .	6, 7
I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility , like , we do now .	6
I think the least people could do is to say they're sorry , or ... something .	6
I thought I could make a difference .	6
I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	6, 7
I thought I was doing smart business .	6, 7
I thought I was the best stud - poker player in the world .	6
I thought we were friends .	6
I told him my problem , I told him I loved you and he told me to keep my trap shut .	6
I told you , you're probably overworking yourself .	6
I took a sabbatical , and I traveled . But no matter where I went , The memory of that awful night	6
I tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real .	6
I tried my best to make a man out of him ... but it look like I failed somewhere .	6
I tried one of them once , but she didn't show any enthusiasm at all .	6
I tried to enlist , they told them to me that I was too ancient .	6
I tried to make her care , but I couldn't .	6
I tried to make it easier for you .	6
I try to help , but he doesn't listen to me , and I've got my own grief to work through .	6
I understand .	8, 6
I used to be popular , wasn't I , [PERSON] ?	6
I used to use my hands .	6
I wan na feel good about something sometime .	6
I want it the way it used to be .	6
I want to be alone .	6
I want to die in my own land , where Human Beings are buried in the sky .	6
I want to die .	6
I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	6
I wanted good things for you .	8, 6
I wanted [LOCATION] , but I wasn't counting on it .	6
I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me .	6
I wanted to blame myself for my dad's drinking , for my mom's crying all the time and her emotional breakdown .	6
I wanted to let you know that the ambulance was late in getting away .	6
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .	6
I wanted to save the ship .	6
I was a child .	6
I was almost in tears .	6
I was ambitious then .	6
I was crazy with jealousy .	6
I was dreadful .	6
I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	6
I was hoping for a miracle , and it didn't happen .	6
I was hoping you'd be spared all this .	6
I was in a really bad place .	6
I was just an ensign .	6
I was never really sure which one I got , nutrition or discipline .	6
I was not a good artist .	6
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good .	6
I was running out of things to say .	6
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .	6
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble .	6
I was starting to miss the old [PERSON] , and now this has happened , and it just ... It feels ... it feels so final , you know ?	6
I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	6
I was the world's nicest guy , and they ruined my life for no reason .	6
I was too late .	6
I was very sick when I was a boy .	6
I was weak and tired , Listless , out of sorts , and ...	6
I was window - shopping in [LOCATION] , daydreaming about what I'd buy for her , if I had any money .	6
I wasn't looking where I was going .	6, 7
I went crazy .	6
I went off because I gained like six pounds ,	6
I will . This isn't exactly comfortable for me . I know you wanted this job .	6
I wish I could believe that .	6
I wish I could have made her understand .	6
I wish I could share your confidence .	6
I wish I could stay .	6
I wish I had a nickel .	6
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	6
I wish I were free tonight .	6
I wish it had gone .	6
I wish it made me feel good too .	6
I wish you could spend some time with him .	6
I won't live long .	6
I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it .	6
I wonder if it isn't a curse to be wised up like you and me .	6
I would hate to commit myself without my compass .	6
I would have sent it to you , but I didn't know your address until today .	6
I wouldn't want him to think I'm not sympathetic .	6
I yielded once before and was practically never heard of again .	6
I , uh ...	6
I'd be so happy if that were really true , [PERSON] .	6
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	6
I'd like your support .	8, 6
I'd only mess that up too .	6
I'd rather be dead .	6
I'd rather take a whipping than mend fences .	6
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	6
I'd waited so long !	6
I'll always regret that I didn't .	6
I'll be sorry to leave Faith .	6
I'll have to write it all over again .	6
I'll miss that man .	6
I'll miss you .	6
It was damn stupid of me , wasn't it ?	6
It was Father's Day ... the last time I heard from her .	6
It was horrible for him .	6
It was my fault .	6
It was nobody's fault but my own .	6
It was our last evening together .	6
It was terrible . He screamed with fear .	6
It was utter chaos .	6
It wasn't about the money , it was just about the anger .	6
It will happen , as it does for all of us .	6
It would be a pity if you died , not me	6
It wouldn't have helped our case .	6
It wouldn't have worked .	6
It'll be broken by dinner .	6
It's a bit humiliating , always borrowing [PERSON]'s place .	6
It's a bitter substitute .	6
It's a fucking slaughter , Lieutenant .	6
It's a liability .	6
It's a lot of time , especially when it stands still with loneliness .	6
It's all I've got left .	6
It's all over , [PERSON] .	6
It's all so horrible , isn't it ?	6
It's all used notes .	6
It's also possible to look at this in , really , just a slightly different way , which is just as sad , maybe even sadder .	6
It's as empty as ashes .	6
It's been a long year .	6
It's called urban blight .	6
It's fine , just a little pain .	6
It's going to be a long night .	6
It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more .	6
It's hard being a dope fiend .	6
It's hard , this fight .	6
It's hard . Just tell me what you need .	6
It's horrible !	6
It's just not okay to be alone anymore .	6
It's just you know that sometimes ... Well , you're not wanted .	6
It's kind of sad , though . All that money and nobody to enjoy it .	6
It's like falling off a log .	6
It's moving back against the wall .	6
It's my fault .	6
It's no good .	6
It's not your fault the plane landed in [LOCATION] .	6
It's nothing . - Nothing at all .	6
It's over , [PERSON] .	6
It's pretty rough .	6
It's so remote I thought I would ... be safe there . I figured no one could find me .	6
It's terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch .	6
It's terrible what happened to him .	6
It's too depressing to think about .	6
It's too late for that , [PERSON] .	6
It's too late to think of him .	6
It's too stupid . Perhaps .	6
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6
It's worse than that .	6
It's , uh , I sold my stuff out . Besides I'm scratched up and ...	6
Jealousy can be destructive .	6
[PERSON] , it's just a disease .	6
JFK .	6
[PERSON] , the insurance is worthless now .	6
John , really , I was only trying to help you out , that's all .	6
[PERSON] was a girl and it seemed hopeless .	6
[PERSON]'s dead .	6
[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	6
Just after she stopped seeing me .	6
Just the usual complications that's all .	6
[PERSON] , I might have died a happy man .	6
l got lost .	6
[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	6
Last night was not so good .	6
Last time I saw him , he threw up scrambled eggs out of his nose on the way to the library .	6
[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	6
Let go . All right .	6
Let it go down .	6
Let me me go somewhere else . I'm sick .	6
Let me tell you , young lady , it is never easy to be the son of a successful father .	6
Let's just say I'm chickenshit .	6
Let's keep this a perfect memory ... and someday this bitter ache shall pass , my sweet .	6
Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books .	6
Life back over there is hard .  	6
Like myself , it struggled blindly for the means to live .	6
Lincoln just ain't the same no more .	6
Listen , I've always returned favors , haven't I , [PERSON] ?	6
Listen , [PERSON] .	6
Little [PERSON]'s been so lonely ...	6
[PERSON] didn't say nothing ...	6
Lonesome picker and watch house will be the first two to come forward .	6
Look , I was a bit of an asshole .	6
Look , I'm sorry to drop by unannounced .	6
Look , it was great to see you again , okay ? I just --	6
Look , [PERSON] , I - I've known all along That you were stealing food and treasure .	6
Looking back ,	6
Looks like it's gonna be a long night .	6
Looks like the Lord sends me about every misery he can think of just to try my soul .	6
[PERSON] , I don't want to hear it .	6
Ma'am , I don't know how to put into words the sorrow I feel .	6
Ma'am , she's no longer a minor . There's nothing we can do . But , but , but .	6
May he rest in peace .	6
Maybe he's got the flu or something	6
Maybe I'm tired of one - night stands .	6
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope .	6
Maybe you should've told her you loved her . Maybe that was the way to make sure .	6
Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .	6
Maybe , but [PERSON] wasn't hunting medals .	6
Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	6
Melancholy sight .	6
[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6
[PERSON]'d be so disappointed if you weren't surprised .	6

My mama's gone to the Lord .	6
My old friend . Not safe .	6
My own husband was killed in this last war .	6
My poor person [PERSON] .	6

My sort of coming of age , which was hard ...	6
My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	6
My wife , God rest her soul , died years ago to the day .	6
My wife , poor girl .	6
[PERSON] , I don't want to leave like this .	6
NCMEC has a slightly different view of its interactions with [PERSON] .	6
Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need .	8, 6
Never I will understand the women .	6
[PERSON] did everything he could , but they got away .	6
[PERSON] , listen to me .	6
No more .	6
No one asked her to worry about me ...	6
No one can help me .	6
No one else is heeding it .	6

Nobody remembers number two .	6
Nobody understands us .	6
Not a happy one .	6
Not fully .	6
Not mentally .	6
Not much comfort .	6
Not the way I'd choose for suicide .	6

Nothing ever happens .	6
Nothing more .	6
Nothing . Nothing .	6
Nothing's ... ever right .	6
Now I know how a poor little guinea pig must feel .	6
Now I've really lost her .	6
Now it's all one big mess .	6
Now what good is all that ?	6
Now you know that the saddest thing in the world is life .	6
Now , then I find myself in [LOCATION] with no money .	6
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	6
Now's not a good time .	6, 7
O dear me .	6, 7
Of course it's been a great trial to your patience , Father ... but think of the burden that it's been to me .	6
Oh , but I can't intrude .	6
Oh , Captain , you got to stop this .	8, 6

Päiväsi on lopussa	6
People do when they've been ill .	6

Remember when [PERSON] said when he was fighting sometimes , he'd fight so hard that he was thinking that he broke something inside ?	6
Remind me to ask you later why your kisses don't seem quite the same .	6
Right , because it's a long shot . You could never love me back .	6
Rocky , I'm sorry .	6
Rocky's hurt .	6
Ruby's been dead for 14 , years .	6
Say bye - bye , now . Bye to daddy .	6
[PERSON] , if you knew what I've gone through !	6
See what you can do ? You weren't even conscious then , for chrissake .	6, 7
See , back then , a man's name was the same as his occupation .	6
Seems a shame to part company after all these years .	6
Seems like it takes a crisis to bring us together lately .	6, 7
Seven passengers and two crewmen were killed .	6
She died trying to save my daughter .	6, 7
She does though . Well , I should say my goodbyes .	6
She doesn't know .	6
She flipped and tried to kill herself .	6, 7
She had long , beautiful brown hair and now she had very short , choppy red hair .	6, 7
She had my finger , you know ...	6
She just seems , I don't know , lonely .	6
She never even went back to the room .	6
She said she's not in a head - space for a relationship , with everything that's going on in the world .	6
She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	6
She told about a mother who was full of hate , and how she got back the hate she gave .	6
She told me that you've been going through some things ... in your personal life .	6
She was a prisoner as I was , and he just heard that she's dead .	6
She was drowned , poor dear , while she was sailing near [LOCATION] .	6
She was very nervous when we left [LOCATION] .	6
She was worried about you .	6
She would be pained to hear you say that .	6
She'll never come back no more .	6
She's an unlucky driver .	6
She's been through enough .	6
She's down .	6
She's dying .	6
She's kind of lost .	6
She's never cared for me .	6
She's sad right now ?	6
She's upset about something .	6
She's very sick .	6
She's very unhappy .	6
She's won and I've lost .	6
Shot her , right outta the sky .	6
Simply no use trying .	6
Simply stated , [PERSON] , it means that you have suffered damage to the brain .	6
Since I'm a one - man show around here , I think I'll forgive myself this one time ...	8, 6
Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid , and I'm still waiting for it .	6
So alone .	6
So be it . I will be the first corpse .	6
So he never saw her again ?	6
So here's the program . You're gonna tell me what is going on , and you're gonna tell me what ideas you have , if you have any .	6, 7
So I say , l don't know . 	6
So I'm gonna be sayin' good night .	6
So much for old business .	6
So the police are extended giving the famous protection , for which we are justly proud in this country , for a finger , eh ?	6, 7
So tired .	6
So when I see you having all these things that I didn't have , I , like , live through your eyes .	6
So you do not recognize me ?	6, 7
So you don't know what happened .	6, 7
So , I take it you've been busy .	6
So , I'm guessing you didn't find my dad .	6
Some of them are carved in stone , some of them men like [PERSON] put up there , so suckers like me could read them .	6
Some official's son got in trouble and they're looking for a substitute	6
Some people don't like my metaphors .	6
Something about a place called [PERSON] .  He's dying . 	6
Something went wrong .	6
Sometimes I think you don't even know I live here .	6
Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways .	6
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run .	6
Sometimes they have an accident .	6
Sometimes , as I'm falling asleep I can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand .	6
Sorry about that .	6
Sorry about the Chiefs , [PERSON] .	6
Sorry about your finger .	6
Sorry I was suspicious .	6
Sorry more people weren't there to hear it .	6
Sorry you had to come back to something like this .	6

Sorry , boys .	6
Sorry , coach .	6
Sorry , nothin' but beer .	6
Sorry , [LOCATION] .	6
Sorry , pal .	6
Sorry , sister .	6

Sounds tough .	6
Stop , wait !	6
Subject is violently antisocial given to delusions of godhood . And he's hopelessly addicted to narcotics .	6
Sunny [LOCATION] will not be that tomorrow .	6
Sweetheart , don't get personal .	6
Sweety , you're supposed to be beddy - byes !	6, 7
Teddy never made it .	6
Tell him you're not going , tomorrow morning or ever .	6
Tell them it was all my fault .	6
Ten suicides there was last year , in one day .	6
Terribly disappointed . It's the last thing I owned .	6
Thank you , but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce .	6
That girl doesn't exist anymore .	6
That hurts .	6
That I knew how miserable you were with him ?	6
That just can't be .	6, 7
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are .	6
That last part , there's something off about it .	6
That means he's flying it .	6, 7
That seems a pity .	6
That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone .	6
That this could be the result of all I had committed my life to .	6
That was my low .	6
That was stupid and cruel .	6, 7
That was the night [PERSON] went away .	6
That will be the toughest part .	6
That won't help you .	6
That'll clip your wings .	6
That's absurdly hypothetical .	6, 7
That's horrible .	6
That's how wars start .	6
That's just my nature .	6
That's no way to remember him .	6
That's not good .	6
That's terrible .	6
That's the only chance you got left .	6
That's the unholy pity of it .	6
That's the way it's been your whole life .	6
That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life .	6
That's what always happens when people fall in love .	6
That's when mine broke up .	6
That's when they start to drift away .	6
The best died there .	6
The bite ... was mine .	6, 7
The boat is gone .	6
The boy's doing so poor these days , why not take him along and air him ?	6
The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .	6
The cheque is no good .	6
The children of my world will have no more stories to read .	6
The death of [PERSON] is a tragedy .	6
The doc just looked at us and shook his head .	6
The drinking , the drugs , that's not a regular thing for me .	6, 7
The fish that got away is always the biggest one .	6
The fun is over .	6
The girls have so little time .	6
The governor sounds unhinged .	6
The helicopter was destroyed , and the pilot is dead .	6
The kid hates me .	6
The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	6
The military has been mobilized , but the violence is so widespread that it is impossible for the rescue services to respond .	6
The moon's out , but there are clouds around .	6
The most damning testimony ... Comes from an abused and frightened child ... Who overcame his fear and his pain ...	6
The most horrible thing was , you'd smile when you were mad .	6
The moving finger had already writ and moved on , and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line , nor would my tears wash out a word of it .	6
The one that you and [PERSON] ditched .	6, 7
The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas .	6
The other day , you looked like you were still hurting .	6
The people with the money in their hot little hands put her up there , and she could do no wrong .	6
The phone is dead .	6
The ponies were dying .	6
The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	6
The preparations for my departure ...	8, 6
The queue was endless .	6
The rolling balls , the second - hand phrases , the migraine headaches ... Shirt - tails , and tonight's speech : I turned yellow but my dog likes me .	6
The same all grind week after week . And so much stress .	6
The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle .	6
The sea shall have you back .	8, 6
The [PERSON] woman died today .	6
The trouble with me ? I'm not very good at looking ahead .	6
The truth is I wanted to quit .	6
The war in [LOCATION] .	6
The witness stand is a lonely place to lie .	6
The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it .	6
Their flowers are dead .	6
Their privilege , their presumption .	6, 7
Then a wasp stung out my eye .	6
Then I lived in many European capitals , trying to forget something sad that happened long ago .	6
Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle , and I started drinking .	6
Then if you did get me well and I went to him , you wouldn't like it .	6
Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6
Then there's no hope .	6
Then there's nothing left for me .	6
Then what are you gonna come home to ?	6
Then , one night , we were talking about how we hated the life , and how we had never done much of anything ourselves .	6
Then , you have to go .	6
Then , you still believed you could make a difference .	6
Then , you'll want to say goodbye .	6
There are estimates out there that . million homeless kids are out on the street at any given time .	6
There are many who can not tell between good and evil	6
There is nothing I can do .	6
There isn't anything to do .	6
There must be something I can do .	6
There was no more innocence anywhere .	8, 6
There was nothing that could be done for her , except wait .	6
There were some problems with ...	6
There . There .	8, 6
There's been enough bloodshed already .	6
There's more bad ?	6, 7
There's no escape .	6
There's no reason for me to be here .	6
There's no time ...	6
There's no way I can have this kind of exposure .	6, 7
There's nobody left around here now .	6
There's not much we can do .	6
There's nothing else I can do .	6
There's nothing I can do about it .	6
There's nothing we can do .	6
There's nothing you can do .	6
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	6
There's someone crying .	6
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do .	6
These are the wrong keys .	6, 7
They always have that same look on their face ...	6
They are the tears of Old [LOCATION] .	6
They both fell .	6
They did the smash - and - grab , she was gonna tell the feds .	6
They didn't miss me at all .	6
They don't know themselves .	6, 7
They failed .	6
They got away .	6
They got hard times as it is .	6
They had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck .	6
They had ...	6
They have lost the ability to communicate and reason .	6
They have no husbands and they cry .	6
They hold together and bring me bad luck .	6
They look like they've come to a funeral .	6
They meant nothing .	6
They mustn't get old .	6
They pay , got that ?	6
They probably will start crying .	6
They said I was crazy , so they sent me to a mental hospital .	6
They screwed him up .	6
They took his coat .	6, 7
They tried .	6
They'd go to Congress and get more funding .	6
They're all dead .	6
They're blaming me for it .	6
They're gonna keep him in that foster home !	6
They're poorly !	6
They're pretty hopeless .	6
They've been kind enough .	6
Things like this create a bad feeling .	6
Think of the years of suffering , deprivation and hardship among those awful savages .	6
This cutter's broken .	6
This dying sticks in my mind and makes me poor company .	6
This has been a long week , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
This has been a terrible shock to them .	6
This hurts me in my heart .	6
This hurts , [LOCATION] .	6
This is a dreadful miscarriage .	6
This is a house of ill fame , and I'm a fallen flower .	6
This is a man's world , a brutal world .	6
This is a very sad day for me .	6
This is all I'm capable of right now .	6
This is awful .	6
This is crazy .	6, 7
This is dreadful !	6
This is history .	6

This is only the tip of the iceberg , as hundreds more have given us their testimony , but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families .	6
This is terrible .	6
This is the society we could have had a century ago .	6
This kid's cryin' , man .	6
This licence has expired .	6, 7
This must be difficult , your life changing so drastically .	6
This strange coffee is a bore , but what can I do when I can't sleep ?	6
This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat .	6
This was my bedroom .	6
This witness will testify about a bar glass . They have no bar glass .	6, 7
This won't work .	6
Those were the last words she heard me say .	6
Though you may think you're having fun now you only hurt the one you love .	6
Three men killed , and to what end ?	6
Three of your neighbors were killed last night .	6
Three ships were lost , you know .	6
Time drags when you're tired .	6
To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honourable state .	6
To do this , we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside .	6
To have to hear it in installments might prove unendurable .	6
To the squad . Are they detaining it , it is ?	6
To think of her struggles , her fruitless cries for help .	6
Toad's friends tried to help him , but were always blocked .	6
[PERSON] , will you ever get out from under Rocky's shadow ?	6

We want to die !	6
We were all a part of what happened to her .	6
We were all praying for a miracle .	6
We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up .	6
We were drilled like little soldiers .	6
We were just talking .	6
We were so very sorry about your father .	6
We won't leave this palace alive .	6
We'd have got married , had a house and children .	6
We'll miss the complimentary beverage .	6
We'll never be parted again	8, 6

We're home free .	6
We're in a war zone , [PERSON] : Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts .	6
We're looking at economic instability , we're looking at housing instability .	6
We're that kind of monster .	6
We're the minorities , man .	6
We've been working too hard .	6
We've got to keep ... Keep daddy happy .	6
We've lost our picture .	6

Well , I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow .	6
Well , I suppose I should thank you .	8, 6
Well , I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life , that I was an outsider .	6
Well , I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing .	6
Well , if he can ...	6

What a shame .	6
What a waste of talent .	6
What bothers you ?	8, 6
What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ?	6
What difference would it make ?	6
What do you have ? What are you hiding ?	6, 7
What he did was , he just took my money .	6, 7
What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life .	6
What if an RD conks out ?	6
What if I just lean back like this ? Would you rescue me if I fell ?	8, 6
What makes you think he'll listen to me ?	6
What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	6
What was your relationship with the deceased ?	6
What will happen to you after I've gone ? They like hearing my stories	6
What would you do if it was your child ?	6, 7
What , it's over ?	6, 7
What's the use of getting excited , [PERSON] ?	6
Whatever I was , that was a long time ago .	6
When an hour alone with you was an impossibility .	6

Yes , Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning ...	6
Yes , sir , I still have the scars .	6
Yes , sir , my apologies .	6
Yes . I'd never have guessed .	6
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day .	6
You ain't got no place to go , [PERSON] .	6
You and [PERSON] just weren't right for each other .	6
You are going to get us all killed If you keep on antagonizing him .	6, 7
You are quite right , and I do not have the right , but I do love [PERSON] .	6
You came as an enemy to destroy me .	6
You can at least , for Christ's sake ... lie to me .	6
You can shoot us now .	6
You can stay at my house because nobody really cares about me .	6
You can't afford this .	6, 7
You can't blame them , can you ?	6
You can't kill him .	6
You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	6
You can not tolerate the faith in humanity , Because if you do , all this ... The structure of your very existence ,	6
You changed that , and you can't change it back .	6
You could call me a freak of nature .	6
You deserve the worst for what you did .	6
You did or did not get those records ? - I did not .	6, 7
You didn't come to my wedding .	6
You didn't tell us ?	6, 7
You disapprove , sir ?	6, 7
You do look pale .	6
You don't care about me .	6
You don't care whether I live or die .	6
You don't have to say the words , Governor .	6
You don't like me very much , do you ?	6
You don't like me , do you ?	6
You don't like to see me enjoying myself .	6
You don't look excited .	6
You don't really think I don't want you to do well ? No , [PERSON] .	6
You don't remember , do you ?	6, 7
You don't seem very excited about it .	6
You don't sound very grateful , Dr. Blood .	6
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at , feet , straight and level over some farm country ? I mean , come on , sir .	6
You don't want us to drink ourselves to sleep .	6
You go ahead and let the grieving process happen .	6
You gonna cry , [PERSON] ?	6
You got one bad seed there .	6, 7
You got ta fix this mess , be it how you fix it with your girl , or how you fix it with [PERSON] , cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this .	6, 7
You got ta settle down or you're gonna wake him up .	8, 6, 7
You hadn't had much contact with her , then ?	6, 7
You hate him ....	6, 7
You hate me .	6
You have our deepest sympathy .	6
You have to go on the road and I have to go through what I'm going through .	6
You hurt his feelings .	6
You insist on putting me into a position that I don't in the least relish .	6
You keep avoiding me .	6
You knew how I felt .	6
You know how I loved her , really .	6
You know I talk to it sometimes , and I beg it to wake me up .	6, 7
You know I've never been able to give you very much .	6
You know too much .	6, 7
You know , all fairness to alcohol , I've done stupid things when I was sober , too .	6, 7
You know , because you think of generals , and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business .	6, 7
You know , I still expect him to come home for dinner .	6
You know , I wanted to blame myself for that .	6
You know . sometimes it feels like it's the only thing keeping us together .	6, 7
You look a thousand years old .	6
You look like death .	6
You look tired , Little Big Man .	6
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	6
You mean you don't love him anymore ?	6
You mean , Dad's not coming home anymore ?	6
You meet somebody and you only got one night to really get to know them .	6
You might have noticed I've got a slight weight problem .	6
You must forgive me .	6
You must get lonely .	6
You must have loved your [PERSON] .	8, 6
You must love someone else .	6
You must rebuild what you've destroyed .	6
You mustn't cry anymore .	6
You only pretended to be my friend .	6
You poor child .	6
You really should be AM and FM ...	6, 7
You reject it .	6
You said you'd never leave me .	6
You see . we're not like you think we are .	6, 7
You spent $ , at The Capital Grille ?	6, 7
You suffered severe brain trauma .	6
You think I killed her .	6
You think it was me that beat you ?	6
You think that by saying ,  I'm sorry ,  all the past can be corrected .	6
You think you should have done something different but it's not your fault that [PERSON] died .	6
You told me that when you overwork you get nervous and lose weight .	6
You were getting over your broken heart .	6
You will hate me now .	6
You won't get him .	6
You won't stay here , and I can't go with you .	6
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here .	6
You , too , think I am too old , too ugly for a man to look upon with love .	6
You'd hate it .	6
You'll go on without me .	6
You'll lose your hair .	6
You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor . That's when you hit the magic button .	6
You're all I ever had .	6
You're blacking out , waking up in places you don't remember , bleeding from where you were shot .	6
You're fired , [PERSON] .	6
You're going bald too .	6
You're good , but you're taking on a lot .	6
You're just being used , you know .	6
You're just saying that .	6
You're killing me .	6
You're like another person .	6
You're not that person anymore .	6
You're right . He has turned against me .	6
You're wasting your time with me . I'm nothing .	6
You've forgotten , this is the th century .	6
You've never known .	6
Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	6
Your mom and I won't be very long .	6
Your mom wasn't ... well , and she needed time to recover , to get better .	6
Your opinion is that this was ... A staged rape ?	6, 7
Your vendetta has dragged on long enough .	6, 7

How do you know how to do all of this ?	7
How do you know it's not you .	7
How do you live with it , Miss [PERSON] ?	7

How'd you find us ?	7
Hsiao - tsing ? !	7
Hundred dollars a night ?	7
Hundreds !	7
I am a clown , and puzzled only by his presence in a place such as this , among such people as us .	7
I and [PERSON] we were already , and I would not believe so fast in someone I eat in him . I am not wrong , he has something in the sleeve .	7
I appreciate your patience .	8, 7
I beg your pardon ?	7
I can be president of the [LOCATION] !	7
I can see that !	7
I can't believe it myself .	7
I can't believe it was you on the phone .	7
I can't believe it .	7
I can't believe that .	7
I can't believe this is you , [PERSON] .	7
I can't believe this . I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper .	7
I can't remember . - You can't remember ?	7
I did a catalogue with his names and residences .	7
I didn't even recognize her .	7
I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral , sir .	7
I didn't expect to see you , Mrs. [PERSON] .	7

I didn't know you were a music aficionado .	7

I didn't know you were still here .	7
I didn't marry her under my real name .	7
I didn't recognize you standing up .	7
I didn't think you'd shoot .	7
I discovered that actually [PERSON] was not in [LOCATION] ... when the storm of battle broke .	7
I do not even know who you are .	7
I don't believe it ! He was down and out and finished !	7
I don't believe it .	7
I don't believe what we have done .	7
I don't know if he was a good man or if he was a bad man .	7
I don't know these sailboats .	7
I don't know what it is	7
I don't know what to say .	7
I don't know , the words just slipped out .	7
I don't mean to be handing you no line , but that's pretty hard to believe .	7
I don't mind it if you call me [PERSON] , you know .	7
I don't see any native girls hungry for affection .	7
I don't think I've seen you before .	7
I don't understand . You're already married .	7
I don't want this !	7
I find this hard to say without sounding condescending , but I'm proud of you .	7
I forgot who I was .	7
I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow And lived to tell about it .	7
I guess [PERSON]'s got more sense than both of us .	7
I guess that's why the old man gave it to you !	7
I had no idea !	7
I hadn't heard you'd sold the place .	7
I have to go now .	7
I haven't been up this early in years .	7
I haven't seen you around their office , though .	7
I haven't seen you for a week .	7
I haven't seen you for days .	7
I hope you don't mind my asking , and , believe me , I'm thrilled that you did , but why did you accept a blind date ?	8, 7
I just didn't believe it .	7
I just got wised up to something funny the last few days .	7
I just had the weirdest dream .	7
I just happen to be taking the same train .	7
I just saved your life , and you still don't trust me ?	7
I killed this person for their money , right ?	7
I know him .	7
I like the bubble . - Yeah ?	7
I mean , if our system wasn't any good , why did they take us over in the first place , right ?	7
I might do that .	8, 7
I must have been crazy .	7
I never imagined what was a work for woman .	7
I never know in advance when I'm going to be a genius .	7
I never mentioned any illness .	7
I never scouted this neighborhood .	7
I never thought I'd make it .	7
I never thought of it ...	7
I never thought of that , sir .	7
I noticed an enormous difference between [PERSON]'s projected figures and the ones off the extro - budget in the [LOCATION] market .	7
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	7
I request a recess .	7
I said , [PERSON] , you're already married .	7
I saw it , but I didn't believe it .	7
I saw the same book in her room .	7
I see that it's funny .	8, 7
I sent you all those letters .	7
I should be back in [LOCATION] , sitting in front of a typewriter , making all this up for a movie .	7
I sit here and I can't believe that it happened .	7
I think so . Sure . Um ...	7
I though you didn't like blood sports .	7
I thought communications were out .	7
I thought he didn't drink .	7
I thought he didn't have any trusted friends except you .	7
I thought he was kidding .	7
I thought he was sick .	7
I thought I gave you plenty of time to ...	7
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you .	7
I thought I was someone who I wasn't .	7
I thought it was all over .	7
I thought it was the old man's	7
I thought politics interested you .	7
I thought that was you .	7
I thought they said they was from [LOCATION] .	7
I thought they were with [PERSON] .	7
I thought you said she got on the helicopter .	7
I thought you said something .	7
I thought you were a confirmed private .	7
I thought you were fast asleep .	7
I thought you were getting fatter , Mama !	7
I thought you were supposed to eat fish on a Friday .	7
I thought you were ...	7
I thought you weren't a romantic .	7
I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow .	7
I thought you wouldn't see [PERSON] now you're back with [PERSON] .	7
I thought you'd be happy .	7
I thought you'd be old .	7
I thought you'd be thrilled to death .	7
I thought you'd gone .	7
I thought you'd question him .	7
I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing .	7
I thought your favourite was chicken .	7
I thought your little cousin was going to sell the stock .	7
I understand perfectly .	7
I understand ! You're provoking me into hitting you	8, 7
I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 , acres .	7
I was just calling because I'm having a game night .	7
I was lucky I come across her last .	7
I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] .	7
I wonder what he's got against the marines ?	7
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect .	7
I wouldn't have believed it .	7
I wouldn't think of such a thing !	7
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	7
I'd always heard how badass you Grimms were , but your mother was a complete letdown .	7
I'd have to lead them through .	7
I'd offer you something harder , but you don't drink ?	7
I'll be damned .	7
I'll be surprised . What about years ?	7
I'm actually beginning to like them .	7
I'm always getting winked at these days .	7
I'm impressed .	7
I'm not playing games right now .	7
I'm pregnant , you know .	7
I'm sorry , I'm conducting an examination .	7
I'm sorry , ma'am , but you're needed in the Situation Room .	7
I'm surprised at you !	7
I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday .	7
I've been called a lot of things , but  comfortable  !	7
I've been looking everywhere for you .	7
I've never been invisible before .	7
I've never done anything like that before in my life .	7
I've never seen anything like it before .	7
I've never seen such activity .	7
I've seen him !	7
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ...	7
If he is to be sacrificed before [PERSON] , why is he not painted red ?	7
If I'd only known , I'd have come straight home .	7
If not [PERSON] , who is it ?	7
If that's all what we all thinking , why isn't someone just come right out and say it ?	7
If you find any keys , hang on to them .	7
Impossible !	7
In charge of piers and warehouses ?	7
In her medicine cabinet ?	7
In other words , you don't know ?	7
Incredible !	7
Incredible .	7
Intriguing young lady , Miss [PERSON] .	7
Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed ?	7
Is he always like that ?	7
Is he really our cousin ?	7
Is it for this that you hold me back from a raid on [LOCATION] ?	7
Is it real ? Is it real pig ?	7

Is it true the ballet's moving out ?	7
Is she the one in the painting ?	7

Is that what this is ?	7
Is that what you want ?	7
Is that what you wanted ?	7
Is that what you're worried about ?	7
Is that why I had to come alone ?	7
Is this absolutely where you live , my dearest one ?	7
Is this how it goes ?	7
Is this our new car ?	7
Is this [PERSON] , who we went to [LOCATION] with ?	7
Is this some sort of a gag ?	7
Is this the time , or I am blind ?	7
Is this Truth or Dare ? Say what ?	7
Isabel , you look very lovely tonight .	7
Isn't that a dog up there ?	7
Isn't that the truth ?	7
Isn't that what this is all about ?	7

Isn't there a guard ?	7
Isn't this a school day ?	7
Isn't this about professionalism ?	7

It astonished me .	7
It is nothing like we figured out .	7
It looks better on you .	7
It looks different here .	7
It must have been here all day .	7
It sounds ridiculous , but the soldiers never lifted a hand to stop us .	7
It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing .	7
It was fine . You've been away all this time ?	7
It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody .	7
It was , uh , bound in human flesh , inked in blood .	7
It wasn't even loaded .	7
It wasn't something that we could see , it wasn't in the paper .	7
It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible .	7
It's a CIT ?	7
It's a glitch in your system .	7
It's a little foggy that you're pissed about 'cause I thought -- ´	7
It's a miracle they lasted as long as they did .	7
It's a miracle .	7
It's a new car .	7
It's a one - way street !	7

There and then before the gods , you made a pact only death could break .	8
There are people eager to work with you .	8
There is a pilot on the radio telling her what to do , telling her exactly how to do it .	8
There must be a reason for this .	8
There must be a reason .	8
There she is , my other monster .	8
There was much to occupy me , So I left my apprentice to deal with [PERSON] .	8
There were others . Most of them are still with me .	8
There . Have no fear , my son .	8

These people want to disappear more than you do . They won't bother us .	8
They ain't gonna quit on me .  	8
They are perfectly safe .	8
They came to help .	8
They can not be here , so we ask you to consider them in your decision .	8
They do not want to separate of you .	8
They may do a better job of it than we have .	8
They spent their own dough to get here , and they came here to see us .	8
They sure have all the right equipment .	8
They think you can do it .	8
